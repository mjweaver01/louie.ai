## ü§ñ LLM Server Methods

The LLM methods are lambda functions, located in the `functions` folder; they are currently hosted by Netlify. However, the server logic is located in `server`. It is relatively amorphous code, and can be adapted to AWS, GCP, Vercel, etc. easily.

NOTE: ensure you have `netlifi-cli` installed, and are signed in.

```bash
yarn netlify
```
