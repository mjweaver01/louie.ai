Unfortunately, much of the extensive experience of the Eastern Bloc countries and the Soviet Union itself has never been published or shared with the rest of the world. This book represents a significant contribution to our knowledge of progressive sports training in children and, in particular, shares the author's concept of the `sensitive ages' for enhancement of muscle strength, speed, endurance, coordination, and flexibility...this text is written in a careful and simple progression of ideas which should be comprehensible to anyone who has had a secondary school level of scientific training and who is also involved in physical education at either the community-based or school-based level. I strongly recommend this book to anyone dealing with or responsible for progressive sports training of young athletes. The truism that children are not simply small adults is especially borne out by this small gem of a book. -- Lyle J.

Written by Anatoly Bondarchuk this book is the culmination of over 20 years of research on the training of high-level athletes and the exercises that were used by them. It brings out how the use of exercises changes with the level of athletic performance and which exercises appear to be most valuable to athletes on a particular level of mastery. In addition, exercises are broken down into different categories ranging from different kinds of general preparatory to specialized preparatory exercises.\nThis breakdown of exercises and the role that they play is the first ever presented. Even though much of the material and many of the examples relate to track and field, the information is applicable to all sports. Strength, speed-strength, speed, power training and the benefits of different exercises are the same regardless of sport. Applications of the information presented in this book can be made to most any sport without any major modifications. This book, that has over 200 pages, and its sequel (Vol. II, published 2010) will be talked about for many years by coaches looking for the latest and most beneficial information on constructing and carrying out the best training programs. It is the first time such information is being made available in the U.S.\nDetails Cover: Paperback Pages: 217 Weight: 1.50lb Level of Difficulty: Moderate",

For stretching, strengthening, and enhancing the leg and calf muscles, most people do not like to exercise. You will be able to stretch your Achilles, tibialis, and gastrocnemius muscles to places they have never been before.Working your ankles high and low with ease, you will feel like you're not even exercising. The results are incredible in less than 3 minutes a day.The main reason this happens is that your toes are straight, not bent. When doing a calf-rise, THE BOB will able you to use the full range of motion with an isokinetic exercise. The calf muscles work from top to bottom with NO STRESS, NO PAIN, to the KNEE at all. THE BOB is great for any age.When you walk, jog or run, THE BOB will make you're exercising simple and easy. All stretching and strengthening of your legs muscles will be enhanced through isokinetic exercise. This is a kind of muscular contraction in which muscles contract at a constant speed against varying degrees of resistance. Isometric is against immovable resistance and does not change the length of muscles. Isotonic is a kind of muscular constant in which muscles contract at varying speeds against a constant resistance, which will affect the tibialis muscle. Both anterior and posterior will help in eliminating the chance for shin splints, an excruciating injury. The gastrocnemius and Achilles will stretch to the full range of motion with the use of THE BOB from both ways. Your Speed, Balance, Quickness, Vertical Jump, and Flexibility will increase for both your personal and athletic use. THE BOB will decrease your chances of injury by using your own body weight. THE BOB will automatically keep you within your natural ability. Gently rock your toes forward, then rock back to your heels, repeating the BOBBING motion from heel to toe. Proper \"foot placement and standing straight up is vital to maintain your center of gravity. Hold on to a wall or counter. You will make a more difficult exercise while gradually placing your feet back further till your toes are on the edge of THE BOB. Reverse THE BOB repeating the same, but moving your feet forward till your heel is at the edge will benefit your Achilles tendon and tibialis muscle. This is the simplest calf builder and strengthener. THE BOB is quick and fun to use and can be used in conjunction with your everyday exercise regimen.",

What started out in 2006 as a collaborative effort between Lou and Jim Seitzer has evolved through five prototypes to become the incredibly strong, kinetic-energy dynamo that it is today. This unique, hand-made Bar weighing only 5.4 lbs, can routinely handle weights in excess of 200 lbs every day - all day long. And it does its job with the utmost precision: conducting and targeting kinetic energy to the shoulders, elbows, biceps and lower back to heal and strengthen stabilizing muscles and allow for healthy joint function.The composite resin center-section of the Bar was specially designed by engineers to be incredibly strong, yet efficient enough to conduct the healing energy generated by just a 10-pound weight. This makes the Earthquake Bar the most sophisticated rehab tool available for post-op surgery patients and newly-injured joint sufferers. But, for powerlifters and everyday workout enthusiasts, the benefits are simply amazing. The Bar literally bullet-proofs the joint by building maximum strength, balance, and, above all, flexibility like no other piece of equipment on earth. This makes it the number one ‘go-to’ apparatus for preventative injury training or prehab. And for strength training, you need to look no further than Westside Barbell for the latest cutting-edge ideas on how the Earthquake Bar can power up your Bench Press. Here, the Bar is an important part of everyone’s Bench training and has proven invaluable in building strong and healthy shoulders.It can hold up to 200 lbs.",

Everyone knows about Westside squatters, but what about their jumping ability? How about a 63.5\" box jump, backed up with a 63\" and a 60\".Jumping is the definition of explosive power- not Olympic lifting, which is a speed strength sport. Explosive power is performed at fast velocity. It is the ability to rapidly increase force (Tidow 1990). The steeper the increase of strength in time, the greater the explosive strength.\nSo how do you develop the explosive strength in the gym?\nThere are several parts to explosive strength development; first, let's look at speed squats and sumo deadlifts which begin this webinar. The squats are done in our three week pendulum wave. Week one, we work with 50% bar weight of our 1RM, 55% in week two, and 60% in week three. Then, we drop back to 50% and start the wave over.However, you must also use bands on the bar, with the weights. The band tension should be 25% at the top (because of band sinkage, add 10% to that in the bottom of the lift). The bands will force you down faster than just weight alone, causing an increase in the kinetic energy. This is the key to reversal strength.\nThe average set/ rep breakdown per workout is 8 sets of two. Immediately following, we then do 6 set of 2 for sumo- style deadlift. For the deadlift, we are also working with 50% bar weight of 1RM, adding bands with 30% tension at lockout (adding 10% in bottom). You will learn that not only will this build a strong finish, but also a strong start, as one must overcome the additional tension at lockout.For the squat wave, the bar weights range from 50-60% of a 1RM, and the top band tension is 25%. This addition turns 50% to 75%, 55% to 80%, and 60% to 85% at lockout. The data from 780 top European weightlifters performed by A.D. Ermakov and N.S. Atanasov show that 50% of the training for speed strength is trained at 75% to 85%. As you can see, this system is well planned, combining explosive strength in the bottom and speed strength at the top. The data chart can be found in Managing the Training of Weightlifters, by N.P. Laputin and V.G. Oleshko (copyright DCD Chanigas).\nThe next part is jumping itself, but against resistance so sign up and watch my Jumping Webinar to learn lots more\"\nIn this Seminar Louie Simmons will clearly explain and show how to develop your General Jumping Ability for all sports.

I started training full time in powerlifting in late 1969 after returning from the army. I had my first power meet in 1966. What an experience! I lifted along with four future world champions: Milt McKinney, George Crawford, who gave me countless tips on squatting, Larry Pacifico, and Vince Anello, who was the deadlifting machine. I asked Vince what helped his deadlift. His reply, \"everything helps my deadlift.\" It sounded vague, but Vince was using the conjugate system, although it was unnamed. George was the squat king. His training was a combination of regular squats, box squats, old Westside style (meaning Culver City, CA, style), rack squats, and good mornings, which contributed to his success.

The value of the top strength has been forgotten. If strength did not matter, then there would be no need for weight classes. But, indeed, there are weight classes and the weights are always larger in the next higher weight class. Every discussion turns to technique in the classical lifts and special pulls. Great emphasis must be paid to technique in the early phases of training, hopefully, starting at age nine and up until 13-years-old. Basic specialization should occur at ages 14 to 15, specialization at ages 16 to 18, the phase of special- ization at 19 to 20, and nally, the high performance stage, beginning at 21-years-old. Whatever age, technique must be taught in the beginning. A basic long-range plan for weight lifting was used by many East Bloc countries like the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Poland, and Bulgaria, whose training was greatly in uenced by the Russians. This is the technique I have followed with several young powerlifters. Kenny Patterson started at age 14 and was an open world record holder at 20-years-old. Joe McCoy started at 14 as well and was an open world champion at 19-years- old. David Hoff started at age 15 and has the all-time greatest powerlifting coef cient at 24-years-old. The Westside system is basically from the former Soviet Union along with our own special exercises for powerlifting. Ninety-nine percent of the training advice comes from the translations of Andrew Charniga Jr. and his collection of weightlifting yearbooks plus many others. I paid great attention to the training of the strongest lifters from the Dynamo club. In an article by I.N Abramovsky in the 1985 yearbook entitled Dynamics of a Weightlifter, he states the most important quality of a weightlifter is strength. While the article is about moving up in a weight class to achieve new records, our top all- time female lifter has broken more than 30 all-time records in the same weight class. This shows that you don’t have to gain weight to become stronger if your body structure is correct for your class. An article by P.A Poleayev and V.S. Kopysov states that it is known that weightlifting achievements depend on the sportsman’s strength potential, which is closely related to his bodyweight. They were not against gaining hypertrophy in the precise muscle groups. Yet again, it is strength potential which is closely related to the lifter’s bodyweight. They were not against gaining hypertrophy in the precise muscle groups. Yet again, it is strength that limits a weightlifter’s progress. As he grows into a higher weight class the strength increases, not just the technique, as it was developed in the early in his career. I believe the constant discussion of technique is to camou age the fact that they don’t know how to make a person super strong. The former Soviet Union had special exercises and special devices to increase strength. The Westside system also has special devices such as belt squat machines, inverse hamstring devices, Reverse HypersTM, plyo swings, and a static dynamic developer. Plus, Westside has numerous special exercises and bars to improve the strongest men and women’s strength. I hope you like this book and I hope you take the word “Can’t” out of your vocabulary. You will nd you indeed can raise the American ag on the Olympic stage once again. Sometimes to win, you must do the impossible, therefore, nothing is impossible.

This book has far-reaching thoughts and ideas as well as very practical information. It brings to light concrete examples of what is involved in the development of sports form - a new concept in the acquisition of the physical and technical qualities being trained for in a specific period of time. In addition, there are extremely beneficial descriptions of different exercises and classification of exercises within GPP and SPP as for example general preparatory, general developmental, specialized preparatory, specialized developmental and so on. Much of this information makes the training all the more effective. Even though much of the material and many of the examples relate to track and field, the information is applicable to all sports. Strength, speed-strength, speed, power training and the benefits of different exercises are the same regardless of sport. Applications of the information presented in this book can be made to most any sport without any major modifications. This book, that has over 200 pages, will be talked about for many years by coaches looking for the latest and most beneficial information on constructing and carrying out the best training programs. It is the first time such information is being made available in the U.S.\nDetails Cover: Paperback Pages: 167 Weight: 1lb Level of Difficulty: Moderate/Advanced",

Is ballistics dangerous? Is there a real need to warm-up? Should you hold your breath while exercising? Do squats damage your knees?\nYou will learn that while cardio is pushed far more than strength and agility training, the simple fact is strength and agility is much more important. Without strength you have nothing. Having weak muscles and ligaments and tendons are why we have an epidemic of joint replacements. Too many people learn about strength training from bodybuilding magazines. There is a difference between just increasing hypertrophy for bodybuilding as opposed to weightlifting or powerlifting.\nJust when you think you have all the answers, Dr. Siff changes questions. Rowdy Roddy Piper would say this as a pro wrestler as he was kicking your ass. The same with Dr. Siff. Can electric stim produce great or a greater muscle contraction on your own? There are so many questions without answers that a must-read book is the Facts and Fallacies of Fitness. It covers fitness and special strength as well as why athletes from nations such as China and Jamaica as well as Kenya are so good at a special sporting event.\nI am sure you will enjoy this book by my old colleague Dr. Mel Siff.\n-Louie\nISBN#: 1-868-183-8\nEdition: Sixth edition 2003\nPages: 310 pages\nCopyright © 2016 by Westside Barbell Inc\nAll rights reserved.

The heavier and stiffer material will give you more compression where you need it to provide even stronger postural correction than the Casual Bowtie. Athletes with muscle imbalances and other issues from years of training for peak performance would benefit from the tighter feel of the Formal Bowtie.\nThe Formal Bowtie can be used for a quick way to warm-up your shoulders before working out. Or, you can wear it while you work out to make sure your form stays tight and on point. Wear it while squatting, deadlifting and benching or while doing various accessory work. Give the Formal Bowtie a chance and you will be able to feel your body transform….your shoulders will love you, we promise!\nMade By Spud inc!",

Do your hands and shoulders hurt more from your rope crunches than your abs??? The solution is the Spud Inc long ab strap! The long ab strap takes all the pressure off of your grip and shoulders allowing you to work your abs to failure. Turn almost any lat pulldown machine or cable pulley machine into an ab machine. The long ab strap can be used for many other exercises such as rear delt cable raises, face pulls, and cable rows.What makes this strap different? Instead of holding onto shorter handles, the long ab strap allows you to hook the strap to your forearms. Not only does this create more strength/stability to handle heavier weights, but it takes the pressure off of your hands, neck, and elbows. This strap makes ab work easier for everyone.If you are looking for another tool to use in your ab workout check out our hanging ab straps, short ab strap, and bodybuilder towel strap.",

To successfully participate in sports today, it is extremely important for all children in this age group to develop coordination, flexibility, general strength, endurance, hand, and eye coordination, and the ability to perform athletic feats. This book begins with brief discussions about training boys versus girls and the role of genetics and heredity but quickly moves on to address training for flexibility, endurance, and physical fitness. The first skill to consider is jumping ability. Jumping is a basic test of explosive power. The higher one can jump with body weight, the more explosive one is. Explosive strength is the ability to rapidly increase force. This means the steeper the increase of strength in time, the greater the explosive strength (Tidow, 1990). There are alternative methods to develop all special strengths for children aged seven to 10 years old. The strength chapter will show how to build general strength without loading the spine. Throughout The Rule of Three, three points you’ll see stressed again and again are 1) the importance of a quality coach in the athlete’s success, 2) the prominent role of an athletic training plan, and 3) the child must be happy, enthusiastic and not overtrained. Details Cover: Online Pages: 101 Level of Difficulty: Easy, Great for anyone wanting to learn how to train younger athletes.",

Over the last several decades, he has worked with multiple Olympic sport athletes.\nAmongst these, one emerged as his top passion project, throwers. The shot-put and discus date back to ancient Greek competition, and combine both power and skill to effectively execute. This latest book authored by Louie outlines the methods he employs which allow such athletes to progress continually.\nThis Read Includes Specific Explanations of:\n-GPP\n-Division of Training\n-Pressing\n-Max Effort\n-Dynamic Effort\n-Repeated Effort\n-Jumping for Explosive Strength A Forward by the Author . \"It is my goal to convince both the coach and the athlete that the Westside System can make it possible to combine strength and power training all year long—not just in the offseason—by integrating all training efforts together. This means the athlete must continue to weight train and perform explosive power training during his or her competition period. It is common to train in blocks for hypertrophy, power, and then strength before the competition period, but then drop all of the blocks with the exception of the events. But, would you do this knowing that a top athlete will lose 10 percent of his or her muscle, power, and strength after 14 to 21 days? It can be said that the same holds true as well for technical skills. Unfortunately, many coaches have the thrower weight and power train with no throws, then start a cycle of throws and zero weight training. The feedback I have received from the throwers I work with shows that they realize this does not work optimally. The good news is that all training can coincide to receive the greatest training effects. Many times a weak muscle group can cause a flaw in technical skills—meaning the throw—and muscle work should not be put aside for long periods of time.\"\nStay Strong,\n-Louie Simmons",

His specialties (amongst others) were welding, steel construction, and crane operation. Louie's favorite style of welding was Torch/M.A.G welding, and that sure came in handy, as many times he would have to cut and weld strength equipment for it to fit in the basement gym where Westside Barbell began.

In a previous location, Westside Barbell had a boxing ring attached to it where the sparring matches were as grueling and bloody as the weight training happening next door.\nLouie loved to train boxing to build up his shoulders and front delts along with his G.P.P, so naturally, he worked the heavy bag and sparred anyone who wanted to jump in the ring with him.

It starts from Louie's childhood and he brings you on the journey he took that lead to the creation of Westside Barbell Columbus Ohio.It is jammed back with insanely strong people and personalities, provides accurate historical events, and best of all, It is 100%, unedited, Louie Simmons.\nThe Author\nThe Iron Samurai is the alter ego of Louie Simmons, the founder of the Columbus Ohio Westside Barbell© Club, established in 1986. Louie’s members have broken more than 100 all-time world records in powerlifting. The Iron Samurai has watched from the sidelines as Louie has acquired several decades of special strength training experience for many sports and as he has been a consultant for many collegiate and professional teams. Louie Simmons is one of only four men to have made Elite totals in five weight classes and was top 10 from 1971 to 2005. Louie has authored nine books, 15 DVDs, more than 250 articles as well as being a current lecturer and he holds 13 United States patents. This is the Iron Samurai’s first and only book. Foreword Louie has traveled the world of strength for more than seven decades. His many triumphs have been equaled by his many setbacks. No setback, however, could stop him from finding a way to succeed no matter how grim things sometimes appeared. The hardest thing for someone to do is to change. Louie knew that he must adapt or perish at his own hands of determination. After having suffered many severe injuries, and death almost claiming his soul in 1991, he also knew death could not take him yet as there were many tasks at hand that still awaited him. One of Louie’s lifters once said that everyone at Westside is just an experiment. Maybe that was true, but he would change how people viewed special strength training around the globe when they saw the results that could be achieved through this training. After many years of educating the public, he achieved a level of mutual understanding primarily because of all the materials he brought forward for all to see and use. Along the way, he learned that it was better to have good people over good lifters. Although the Iron Samurai is one of Louie’s alter egos, it was not the one that replaced him in training or competitions. That one he says will go to the grave with him never to be revealed to others. His advice to everyone who reads his story or follows his life adventures is to make your own choice—choose the ball or choose the sword, but choose wisely. Doris Crawford Simmons.\nNote Unlimited Access Conjugate Club members have access to this book included with their membership.",

Over the last several decades, he has worked with multiple Olympic sport athletes.\nAmongst these, one emerged as his top passion project, throwers. The shot-put and discus date back to ancient Greek competition, and combine both power and skill to effectively execute. This latest book authored by Louie outlines the methods he employs which allow such athletes to progress continually.\nThis Read Includes Specific Explanations of:\n-GPP\n-Division of Training\n-Pressing\n-Max Effort\n-Dynamic Effort\n-Repeated Effort\n-Jumping for Explosive Strength A Forward by the Author . \"It is my goal to convince both the coach and the athlete that the Westside System can make it possible to combine strength and power training all year long—not just in the offseason—by integrating all training efforts together. This means the athlete must continue to weight train and perform explosive power training during his or her competition period. It is common to train in blocks for hypertrophy, power, and then strength before the competition period, but then drop all of the blocks with the exception of the events. But, would you do this knowing that a top athlete will lose 10 percent of his or her muscle, power, and strength after 14 to 21 days? It can be said that the same holds true as well for technical skills. Unfortunately, many coaches have the thrower weight and power train with no throws, then start a cycle of throws and zero weight training. The feedback I have received from the throwers I work with shows that they realize this does not work optimally. The good news is that all training can coincide to receive the greatest training effects. Many times a weak muscle group can cause a flaw in technical skills—meaning the throw—and muscle work should not be put aside for long periods of time.\"\nStay Strong,\n-Louie Simmons",

Mel was a good friend and an expert on biomechanics. Mel was a huge fan of Westside and Westside was a huge fan of Mel. He is known mostly for Supertraining, but a lesser known book Facts and Fallacies of Fitness is a must for all coaches and trainers. As the title points out, sometimes it is hard to tell the difference without a lot of years’ experience. You may find that you are doing yourself and your clients more harm than good.This book can help one become a competent personal trainer. Is ballistics dangerous? Is there a real need to warm-up? Should you hold your breath while exercising? Do squats damage your knees? Remember, as they say, a little knowledge is dangerous, and many internet geniuses don’t have that much known age, yet have a huge fan base.\nYou will learn that while cardio is pushed far more than strength and agility training, the simple fact is strength and agility is much more important. Without strength you have nothing. Having weak muscles and ligaments and tendons are why we have an epidemic of joint replacements. Too many people learn about strength training from body building magazines. There is a difference between just increasing hypertrophy for body building opposed to weightlifting or powerlifting.\nThere are many contradictory statements concerning strength and fitness, but Mel breaks it down between a fact or a fallacy in a way that is understandable. Many rejected the Soviets and their sport training due to political reasons rather than to sports science.The NSCA. provides very low level basic knowledge of sport training. In the former Soviet Union one could earn a degree for coaching; this is not the case in the United States. Only Westside Barbell offers a coaching degree. Oh, by the way, it has an 85 percent failure rate thanks to Dr. Mel Siff.\nThe answers to such questions as “Does weightlifting increase blood pressure?”, “Is touching your toes dangerous?”, “Does heavy weight training hurt your speed and flexibility?”, “Should you push your stomach in or out to stabilize your truck?”, “What is a max effort and can it be done more than once?”, “Are straight leg sit-ups dangerous?”, and “Is PNF stretching really a stretch?” are provided.\nThere is much more to think about if you are to become a top coach or trainer: Do sit-ups make your waist smaller? Are Goodmornings dangerous? Should you lock the knees at the end of a squat? Is a stationary bike as good as a real bicycle? Is running on a treadmill the same as running on a track or road? There are countless questions like this without solid answers.\nIs it safe to have women do high weight training like weight lifting or powerlifting? Do you know the definition of fitness? What is OPP. and is it useful for the weight or powerlifting? Have you thought about when you stop endurance training? Are there different types of muscle fiber and if so which is best for a sprint or a marathon? What is best for each?\nAnd consider these: How does one test top strength potential? Is an irregular heart unhealthier? What is oxygen belt? Which is safer, a flat back or a rounded back? Does connective tissue grow strength at the same rate as muscle tissue? How do you correct pelvic tilt?\nJust when you think you have all the answers, Dr. Siff changes questions. Rowdy Roddy Piper would say this as a pro wrestler as he was kicking your ass. The same with Dr. Siff. Can electric stim produce great or a greater muscle contraction on your own?\nThere are so many questions without answers that a must-read book is the Facts and Fallacies of Fitness. It covers fitness and special strength as well as why athletes from nations such as China and Jamaica as well as Kenya are so good at a special sporting event.I am sure you will enjoy this book by my old colleague Dr. Mel Siff. -Louie",

This is called periodization. In 1917, Kotov, of the former Soviet Union, wrote a series of texts about training that considered general preparatory and specific needs. Most lifters would use a progressive gradual overload system. Here, the reps were high in the beginning with light weights. Then over time, the weight became heavier and the reps lower, leading up to a contest. This is simply a detraining system. The muscle-building phase is first, along with speed strength. As the weights grow larger and the reps are decreased, the hypertrophy is lost. The maximal strength phase begins, but bar acceleration speed is lost and contest training consumes the bulk of the training. This makes peaking for a meet very unpredictable. Dr. Matveyev realized in 1981 a more sophisticated wave periodization must be utilized than his first models in 1964. Sports scientists such as Verkhoshansky, Vorobyev, and Ermakov found the same to be true. The system of equal loading of skill and strength training was common in track and field. This was also considered by Bondarchuk, but Bondarchuk’s idea was to develop skill first to take advantage of the strength increases. Top Olympic lifters in the former Soviet Union would use over 50% of their training on special exercises to increase the totals. Around 80 special exercises and 20 skills, while wave loading, were given priority for about 5-8 weeks at a time by Verkhoshansky in the late 1970s. This was to contribute to the next wave of 5-8 weeks. This system was for highly qualified athletes and lifters. Westside training is much more weighted toward special exercises. Our waves never last longer than 3 weeks for speed strength and 2 weeks for strength speed. For Olympic lifters, squatting was front and back squats with only one bar. Westside can change volume in the same intensity zones by using a wide variety of special bars, but what about programming? What does it consists of? What do you change during the year? I feel top powerlifters should compete two times a year in a full power meet and maybe one bench meet or one deadlift meet. There are four phases of training in a yearly plan. They should start after a meet. As the training continues, it is important to know the terminology and what is expected during each and every training phase leading up to an important contest. Let’s look at each phase independently starting with the accumulation phase.\nAccumulation Phase First many would consider this off-season training, but athletes cannot have time off: no vacation, just training and work toward increasing their ability. At Westside, we concentrate on improving bar speed in all squatting and deadlifting workouts on Friday and on Sunday for speed strength benching, commonly known as the dynamic day. We rotate many special bars to change the volume while maintaining the same bar speed at the same intensity zone, or percentages. The training must be dense, meaning very short rests between sets. You must work to raise your training volume at all percentages; adding hypertrophy, increasing bar speed, and perfecting technique are essential. This period of training was intended to increase speed of movements in all sports, especially track and field, but we use this period after a meet for all aspects of increasing special strength gains as we work on weaknesses to increase skills in all lifts and also increasing GPP. After all, you must recover from more difficult workouts to succeed in any sport.\nIntensification Phase In this phase of training the lifter or athlete will push his or her training toward the sport itself. For a powerlifter the 3-week wave style of cycling is essential. Using the same exercises for more than 3 weeks creates a negative result. The 3-week wave will help eliminate this phenomenon. In this period of training you must increase the rest time between working sets. The training is now directed toward your sporting goals. For the powerlifter, this means reducing the fun exercises and start using ones that build strength specific to powerlifting.\nTransformation Phase This period of training starts the competitive phase for track and field. At Westside this is the circa-max phase, based solely on the squat training weeks. In week 1 work up to the top weight of your all-time best. For Westside that means a box record. During week 2, work up to approximately 90% of your all-time best. In week 3 use 50% of your all-time best for 2 sets of 2 reps. Week 4 is the meet. Note: A 3-week reverse wave pendulum is used.\nDelayed Transformation This reverse wave loading was used for Naim Suleymanoglu by his coach Abadjiev. The transformation phase lasted for 3 weeks. The third week revolves into the delayed transformation, or rest period. During the transformation phase, deadlifts for sets are used at moderate percents. Not counting abs, only two or three special exercises are used. Westsiders will wear a bench shirt 3 weeks out, and the last heavy pull is also 3 weeks out. I hope you can relate to a plan that is intended to maximize the weight lifted at contest time. If you use this plan, you will not be scratching your head and wondering why the weights you lifted in the gym did not materialize at meet time.\nLouie Simmons ReferencesEmverturkileri, Y.; Suleymanoglu, N.

It was trial and error, but our lifts were going up at a fast rate. It would seem we were on track with our training, but were we? How could we know? Who is V. M. Zatsiorsky? Now serving as a professor at Pennsylvania State University, he received a Ph.D. in biomechanics from the Central Institute of Physical Culture in Russia.\nHe has memberships in the International Society of Biomechanics, American Society of Biomechanics, American Academy of Kinesiology and Physical Education, American College of Sports Medicine, and the Motor Control Society.\nHe also has scientific advisory over 70 Ph.D. dissertations and has publicized over 350 scientific papers, plus 19 patents and 15 books. This makes Dr. Zatsiorsky a giant in the world of special strength development.\nManaging the Training of Weight Lifters, the 1982 book by N.P. Laputin and V.G. Oleshko first gave a plan for organizing training, meaning periodization. But before that it was A. S. Prilepin’s Charts of Loads that lead to regulating volume and intensity. Then, Supertraining by Yuri Verkhoshansky led me to wave-style periodization and to perfect it for meet day. Science and Practice of Strength Training discuss delayed transformation.\nWhen hand training is going on, it is most difficult to reach the highest standard for two reasons. One, it is hard to fully adapt to the training effects. Second, one must counter fatigue that is caused by the high volume of training inside the weekly plan. To reach the highest possible results at meet time, one must taper the training starting 21 days out from a meet; at 14 days out you reduce squat to 75 percent; at seven days out to 50 percent for men under 110kg; over 110kg will do only small special exercises. This system came from Soviet track and field, Soviet weight lifting, and Bulgarian weight lifting.\nNext, Delayed Transmutation with a Twist While delayed transmutation is intended to stop training a lift all together and to do many large barbell exercises and small special exercises on mostly benches of special machines, you should start doing the lift again in a month or two. At Westside, 80 percent of our training is on special exercises and 20 percent on the classical lifts. We push up all special exercises, but maintain the training on the classical lift. This allows us to gain strength in a lacking muscle group with special exercises, which are rotated on a mostly weekly basis. The extreme training is spaced 72 hours apart with small workouts every 12 to 24 hours.\nThe Theory of Adaptation The theory of adaptation means one will adapt to the environment they are placed in. Two things a lifter must possess – speed and strength. At Westside on Fridays we do squat workouts where speed strength is trained. One hundred squats a month is performed along with doing 60 to 80 speed pulls. This is intermediate velocity for speed strength. Seventy-two hours later a Maximum Effort (M-E) workout is done. The bar velocity is slow including zero velocity when isometrics are done. The volume on M-E workouts is very low ranging from 30 percent to 35 percent of the dynamic workout. Our intention is to lift a weight as fast as possible or as heavy or slow as possible. Our training is to adapt to both velocities.\nThese are types of adaptation: Stimulus magnitude or overload – meaning one to increase volume in the correct intensity zones.\nConstantly finding ways to break new barriers – to adapt to training is to never completely adapt to specialized training. This is done by changing special exercises on a regular basis, as well as the volume and intensity. Remember, the difference in volume from dynamic day and an M-E day as well as the intensity zones.\nSpecificity – one must raise sport specific skills. This must be done early in the athlete’s career. There is no need to be strong in the wrong exercises.\nIndividualization – the coach or athlete must realize the special needs on not only the events the athlete will compete in, but also selecting the current loads in correct intensities for their sport. Theory of Overload How does one increase their work load – meaning volume? If you remember A. S. Prilepin’s data of the number of classical lifts in intensity zones, the most reps at 70 percent is six, at 80 percent is four, and at 90 percent is two. Why? The bar speed would be too slow and form would break. So how can one overload? The answer is special exercises like pulls, presses, and squats, plus small special exercises. This is shown in a System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting by A. S. Medvedev. The book was his study with Y. V. Verkhoshansky of the conjugate system. Why not raise classical exercises? Technique will suffer, but it does not matter when using general exercises. They have no ill effect on timing, coordination, or flexibility. This is the only way to increase total volume. The men at Westside will do 150,000 pounds on the Reverse HyperTM exercise machine, plus lots of heavy static holds in a belt squat machine in a weekly plan. How? Both provide traction of the spine while exercising. Get the most out of an exercise; don’t let it get the most out of you.\nTraining Methods\nWhat is strength? Strength is the athlete’s ability to generate maximum external force. In The Science and Practice of Strength Training, it talks about the only three scientific methods to develop maximal muscular tension. The most effective method to build maximum strength is the maximal effort. It is best for improving intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. It is known that the central nervous system will adapt only to the load placed on them. One cannot only use the M-E method for complete strength development. The volume and intensity must change every 72 hours. For this reason, Westside used a second method of strength development – the dynamic method. This method requires one to throw or lift a non-maximal load with the highest possible velocity. It is impossible to attain maximum force (Fmm) in fast movement against intermediate resistance. This shows the dynamic method is not used for increasing maximal strength, but only to improve the rate of force development and explosive strength. The dynamic method changed the Westside system in 1982 forever. The third method is the repeated effort method, which many will use with heavy weights for six to eight reps. This method builds muscle mass by doing the higher reps, but only strength on the final rep in a fatigued state. In the classical lifts, it can cause injury to the weakest muscle groups – meaning pulling a pec in bench pressing, or straining the lower back while pulling or squatting. Like science experiments, single joint exercises are used for safety. Westside has found a similar approach by doing many extensions for the triceps, knee, lower back, hamstrings, and the like. This has made it possible for Westside to continuously raise total volume by using large and small special exercises. The Reverse Hyper volume can be for 100 to 150,000 pounds per week. Note – there can be some confusion on the number of M-E lifts in a yearly plan.\nThe Bulgarian weightlifter would lift a max 4,000 times a year. While the Soviet Union lifter, like Westside lifters, do about 600 maxes a year. The difference was how the two teams determined a max. The Bulgarians would count on a daily max. Theirs was a training max (TFmm) while the Soviet Union, like Westside, counts only all-time maxes (CFmm).\nThe Science and Practice of Strength Training explained that strength is measured in velocity, not weight. Explosive strength is in fast velocity – about 30 to 40 percent. Speed strength is in intermediate velocity – about 70 to 85 percent. Strength speed is in slow velocity – 90 percent and above. And of course, isometric strength is measured at zero velocity. This is also where maximal strength is measured.\nExperts classified strength by the change of muscle length. So isometrics are constant. Because of no shortening of length, there is little to no inflammation. This can be a major plus in training. Also, when doing static work, the effect of work can vary 15 degrees above and below the bar position.\nBecause strength training can be aimed at certain muscle groups and certain muscle groups will vary greatly from one to another, a wide range of small special exercises must be employed. For instance, one can rotate for the hamstrings, standing leg curl, laying leg curl, calf ham-glute raises, the Westside inverse leg curl, and band and ankle leg curls for 100 to 200 reps for soft tissue strengthening.\nWe can go on and on, but let’s look at the relationship to force and velocity. Look and study Hill’s equation of muscle contractions. It is easy to see motion velocity decreases as external loads increase. This means that maximum force (Fmm) is attained when velocity is small. This means maximum velocity (Vmm) is attained when external resistance is close to zero. Here are three examples that will be easy to recognize: A javelin is very light and when released, its velocity is above 30 meters per second.\nA shot put at 16 pounds is released at about 14 meters per second by top throwers.\nWhen training the deadlift at 60 percent of a 1 rep max, the bar moves at roughly one meter per second. This clearly shows the relationship between force and velocity. This is just a small teaser of what information you can find in V. M. Zatsiorsky’s Science and Practice of Strength Training. If you truly want to be knowledgeable about strength training and the science behind it, the book is a must. Thank you V. M. Zatsiorsky for making it possible for Westside to accomplish what is has over the last 34 years.",

It gives a more simplistic overview of how he used and enhanced the conjugate method of strength training. It also answers Louie's three most asked questions about this method and its utilization. How did he adapt the Conjugate Method to his athlete's training? What type of strength should you train, and when should you do it? Does this training system work for Football, Track and Field, Combat Sports, and Raw Powerlifting?

If done properly, the sports organization will gain a competitive advantage contributing to victory at the highest levels.”\nThis is exactly what Dr. Peter Smolianov and Jed Smith detail for you in Fringe Methodologies in High Performance and Health. This book includes methods for improving performance, recovery, nutrition, and health in both elite sport and the general population.

As a researcher, Dr. Harre contributed greatly to the development of a “General\nTheory of Training”. In, addition, his work included the education of coaches,\nsports clinicians and scientists as well as research with competitive endurance\nathletes in sports such as Olympic rowing and kayaking. The book: Without a doubt, Principles of Sports Training is the most significant work in the\nfield of “General Theory of Training” in the German language. First published in\n1969, the title has influenced generations/ thousands of students, coaches and\nsports scientists. Rooted in the East-German system of competitive sports, this work provides a\ncomprehensive view on basic principles and an organized approach to sports\ntraining. Even though the book is still being printed in German, this is the first time in more\nthan two decades that an English edition is made available. This book is a must-have for everyone who wants to have a basic understanding\nin training theory and the East-German approach to competitive sports.",

From the outside looking in, the solution to getting an athlete “in shape” may seem simple. However, this has been one of the most contentious problems in athletics for some time. Mladen Javonavic provides practical, scientific solutions for this issue his new manual for high intensity interval training. The HIIT Manual is organized in two main sections: HIIT basics and HIIT planning. HIIT basics covers the following major points:\n– Understanding the “Endurance Map” and terminology\n– Equipment that is needed to test and prescribe HIIT conditioning\n– Understanding the “Velocity Profile”\n– Estimations of key HIIT parameters, that are needed for prescription and profiling\n– Prescription of the HIIT conditioning, corrections using start loss and COD loss, as well as grouping of athletes\n– Different HIIT drills – long intervals, short intervals and tempo, sprint interval training, repeat sprint training, and intermittent recovery\nThe planning part of the HIIT manual outlines the basis of Agile Periodization, which is a framework of approaching planning from an uncertainty perspective. HIIT planning covers:\n– Understanding uncertainties involved in training planning and realization\n– Three levels and types of analysis: phenomenological, mechanistical, and physiological\n– Answering “what should be done” and “when should it be done” using simple heuristics\n– Top-up approach to planning HIIT conditioning\nUnderstanding the above will empower you in selecting, designing and planning HIIT conditioning for both individual and team sports.",

Some of the topics addressed in this edition (in addition to the previous information) are velocity loss, different technologies for VBT, force-velocity profiling, and individual load-velocity profiling.\nVelocity loss is a very versatile means for VBT that enables you to determine how much fatigue you want the athlete to accrue. The amount of fatigue accrued will drive the adaptations. For instance, if the coach wants to minimize fatigue while still training heavy, a minimal velocity loss (10%) can be implemented. This will allow a stimulus while not overpowering the system, preventing the resistance training from requiring too much energy for recovery. If an athlete needs to increase muscle mass appreciably, a larger velocity loss (40%) would be utilized to maximize hypertrophy. This and much more is delved in to for velocity loss.\nThere are many different types of devices to measure the velocity of the barbell currently. It is difficult for someone to understand what the devices do and how they work to derive velocity. There is definitely a cost to benefit analysis that needs to be undergone to make the appropriate choice for your unique situation. Having an understanding of the pluses and minuses of each technology enables you to make the best decision.\nForce velocity profiling in this text essentially breaks apart the power calculation into its components of force and velocity. By understanding how the athlete develops power through these two components, it enables more informed decisions with how training should be guided. In this section we also discuss how to determine what the athlete needs to enhance power to the greatest extent.\nFinally, individual load velocity profiling is going to be discussed in detail for the first time in this text. Zones rely on averages, and there are many instances in research when not a single individual will possess a mean value. Currently there is a trend towards strength coaches working with smaller groups, having a more favorable coach to athlete ratio. The more favorable ratio coupled with an increased understanding and utilization of velocity can enable the coach to examine the individual load-velocity relationship rather than the group mean. This may lead to greater increases in the athletes adaptations for speed and power.\nIt has taken five years for this update to come to fruition, and we are excited to be able to bring it to you in a no nonsense and the easiest to understand manner. We hope you find this book informative and enjoyable.",

Just press the Zercher Pad onto a racked barbell and start squatting, lunging, or carrying the barbell with ease. Until now, trainers and athletes alike avoided zercher movements due to the discomfort of placing a barbell in the elbow crease. While knee sleeves and folded yoga mats help with the pain, they’re insufficient at best. The Zercher Pad’s molded, lightweight foam construction is soft to the touch yet strong enough to support a loaded barbell. The Zercher Pad weighs under 2 lbs and stores conveniently in your gym when not in use.\nThis AbMat innovation was inspired by Christina Lazo, a local powerlifter in St. Louis, MO and member of the AbMat team. She expressed interest in performing Zercher Squats but with less pain. After over 12 months in development the Zercher Pad was born.\nSpecs: Made in the USA 28” in length Fits both 28mm and 25mm Olympic barbells Molded foam construction Antimicrobial Patent Pending",

The circular foam discs slide on between plates to create a small gap just wide enough to easily remove the plates when you’re done with your workout, eliminating the need to try and pry the plates apart. They also reduce damage to the plates—especially metal ones that are prone to chipping due to blunt impact—by providing a cushioned barrier when you drop a new plate on. An added benefit is that sled spacers effectively reduce unwanted sound.\nAbMat’s Sled Spacers are an inexpensive way to prolong the life of your equipment, protect your fingers, and save you time so you can focus on your workout.

Plate Spacers add 3.75” to each side of the bar adding a level of safety and security when racking and un-racking weights.\nBand re-tensioning is a breeze with Plate Spacers and doesn’t require lifting a loaded bar. Plate Spacers allow bands to rotate under tension independently from the barbell. Simply spin the Plate Spacers for easy band adjustment.\nPlate Spacers weigh 2.5 LBS each and are sold in pairs.\nThis product was created by Donnie Thompson over a decade ago to assist athletes with frozen joints and limited mobility. These athletes often had trouble re-racking specialty bars when bench pressing. As a result, Donnie took a 2.5 LB plate and an old PVC pipe and put it on his bench station and has never taken it off. During a visit with Donnie at The Storage Shed in S.C., Donnie discussed this with the AbMat team…fast forward 6 months and Donnie now has a permanent solution that can also be used as 2.5 LB change plates.\nThe Plate Spacers are American Made out of powder-coated steel. This is a limited run of 100 sets. Inventory is ready for immediate shipment.

He came to AbMat with an idea, and they worked together to fine-tune the design that brought the Preacher Pad to life, which is a space-saving, low-cost alternative to buying a preacher curl machine. By simply placing the pad in your lap when seated, you instantly create the perfect angle to perform preacher curls, all while using the contours of your body as a natural support for the cushion. Though designed to rest in your lap, the Preacher Pad can also rest on a bench top, plyometric box, or similar support.\nSPECS: Made in the USA Soft Black Vinyl High Density Foam White Printing Dimensions: 24\" L x 13\" W x 8\" H Inventor: Adam Hensley",

The barbell bomb is made out of a high-density foam that will stand the test of time while weighing in at only 4 ounces. With the Barbell Bomb attached to a barbell you can do everything you would do with a traditional landmine. Including:\n• Presses• Rows• Rotational work• Push presses• Push jerk• Squats• Split Squats• Lumberjack deadliftsAnd so much more! Dimensionally the Barbell Bomb is about 7\" long and will take up about 5.5\" of the barbell sleeve when installed. Additionally, the Barbell Bomb can be used as a handle for the opposite side of the barbell to provide a very comfortable grip for movements such as push presses and goblet squats. The Barbell Bomb is Patent Pending. Inventors: Eric Chessen, Ryan Pitts, AbMat Team",

After destroying yet another pad trying to make it do something it wasn’t intended to, inventor and gym owner Devan Grell got to work creating the solution—and Hip Thrust Pads were born.\nThese innovative pads are designed for durability, longevity, and maximum comfort and are constructed with unique multi-layer well technology. The harder top bears and evenly distributes the weight of the load while taking pressure off your pelvis, and the ultra-soft bottom layer offers extreme comfort enabling maximum hip thrust performance. Additionally, Hip Thrust Pads won’t hinder your hinge like some other products might that simply wrap around the bar. Hip Thrust Pads bend with your body, allowing you to effectively and comfortably get deep into the movement.\nProudly made in the USA, look no further than the Hip Thrust Pad for the safety and stability you need to get the results you love from the hip thrust movement.

Simply rack your barbell and snap the Pivot Pad on to the bar. The pad performs like a commercial grade hip thrusting machine at a fraction of the price – and footprint. The pad has a soft foam exterior and rigid core.\nPerforming hip thrusts on a traditional bench can be uncomfortable, difficult to get set up, and uses a fixed height that doesn’t lend itself to proper biomechanics. The Pivot Pad puts the user in a proper position based on their height and makes getting into the movement a breeze. Simply sit on the ground with your upper back against the pad and begin thrusting. Though the Pivot Pad was designed to accommodate all types of hip thrusts including barbell, dumbbell, and banded hip thrusts, it is not limited to this single movement. The pad works great for other accessory work including single arm presses, glute marches, Copenhagen planks, and rear-elevated push-ups to name a few.\nThe patent-pending keyhole design of the Pivot Pad snap directly onto a olympic barbell and rotates with the user creating an immersive experience – almost as if the pad isn’t there. Use the Pivot Pad in conjunction with our Hip Thrust Pad for the most comfortable and convenient hip thrust solution.\nThe Pivot Pad is a collaboration between Dr. Kelly Starrett of the Ready State and AbMat. Kelly approached the AbMat team and wanted a solution for performing Split Squats using a barbell (Split Squat Pad). A byproduct of our talks led to the creation of the Pivot Pad.\nSPECS: American Made Small footprint (18” x 10” x 3”) Easy to store Soft foam exterior + rigid core Dual material construction Solid molded foam Cleanable, textured exterior Embossed logos that won’t wear over time Patent Pending Inventors: AbMat team, Kelly Starrett, & Kyle Divine",
