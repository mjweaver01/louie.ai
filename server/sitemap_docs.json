I am happy to answer this question.\nFirst of all Westside has made more all-time world records then any powerlifting gym in the world.\nThe methods I used are the methods used by the former Soviet Union weight lifters. The Chinese also adapted the same basic system and are doing great things. Much of our M-E training is based from the Bulgarian System. Many people don’t know that much of the Bulgarian training came from the Soviets.\nMuch of their research came from men like Felix Verikovsky, L.N. Sokolov and N.I. Luchkin, the father of Soviet weight lifting biomechanics.\nIt is not a completely new and different system that is discussed today in the United States.\nOn a six-day system, special barbell exercises were more than the classical lifts’ three-days-a-week system.\nLike Westside the Chinese and the Soviets’ special exercises were the way to consistently raise total volume, which is necessary to reach the top.\nThis is shown in my strength book when L. Ihrbotinsky’s progress stopped after winning the 1960-64 Olympics. After some research it was found his average weight by percent and total volume were somewhat less. After knowing this, it was pushed back upward and once again he started to make progress.\nThe controlling of intensities, volume and lifts per workout is constantly shown in 50 pages of managing the training in a weekly, monthly, yearly and, of course, a multi-year periodization in our strength book for weight lifting.\nI am asked many times by Olympic weight lifters if the conjugate system will work for a weight lifter. I answer yes, it came from Olympic weightlifting. It was an experiment at the world famous Dynamo Club. (By the way, it means power in motion. It was made up for Physical Education including 45 sports team.)\nMany renown sports scientists tried an experiment called the Conjugate System for weight lifting. It used 20 to 45 classical and special lifts and exercises to enhance weight lifting with 70 high-skilled weight lifters.\nAfter the initial cycle one lifter was satisfied, but the rest wanted more.\nIt would grow to 100 weight lifting exercises.\nIt was common to have all the lifters use basically the same program. The Conjugate system’s purpose was to use many special exercises that were based on the phasic structure of the lifts.\nThis was designed by A.A. Lukashev in 1972.\nBy choosing the correct special exercises for the lifter, strength could be emphasized at a certain phase of the classic lift. This also brought about an improvement in speed strength abilities.\nMany of the special exercises were, of course, much different by standing on a box to clean or using a closer grip to snatch.\nThis would cause one to emphasize strength development in certain muscle groups.\nThe theory was to build strength in individual muscle groups and increase mobility, and flexibility this would lead to an increase in technique.\nTo enhance mastery of technique is measured by many methods.\nBy using many special exercises, it is then possible to raise volume, not only in the beginning of the training, but continued close to double the volume at high intensity.\nThis made training more enjoyable and more interesting.\nThis did many things, first raising work capacity, which is lacking in the U.S.\nAlso, it showed that because of the effect of direct single muscle group strength improvements it improved speed strength and coordination in the classic lifts.\nAt Westside the powerlifters do special exercises 80 percent of the time. Westside has the greatest coff squatters male and female, the greatest bench pressers male and female, plus the current best all time male and female lifters of time by using the system made for Olympic weight lifters. How? By choosing the correct exercises for the powerlifters.\nIn the strength manual you find many programs to choose from and rotate as you see fit. The ones that are most difficult are the ones that will contribute to raising the Olympic lifts.\nSpecial Notes:\nWestside has seen that the squat lacks front and back as well as high degree of back strength in the weight lifters that visit Westside.\nOn special leg and back exercises the Olympic lifter falls far behind our powerlifters.\nThis should not be the case. Monkey see, monkey do. Watch the web and watch the Russian and Chinese workouts.\nYou will note that they all have a large squat. The front squat is always at least 100l pounds above their clean. Why? Because it requires a very strong squat to not only recover from a heavy clean, but be able to have the reserve to jerk the bar overhead.\nThe manual shows how to improve the squat and has countless special back exercises to improve your back strength to lift new records.\nOne should be as strong in the special lifts as possible.\nTry to increase your GPP by pulling a weight sled 60 yards a trip for up to 10 trips. This will build all lower body muscles and help recovery. I will leave you with this: The SHW Alexis who broke more world records then any other Olympic weight lifter‑‑80 in all‑‑did the following at times: Power snatch 100kg for 100 times. Stand in waist high water and pull weights from the bottom to the top. And for GPP would walk in a pool for 1000 steps to build his abs, and condition his legs.\nWhy? Because they help his lifts.\nPlease Read:\nA System of Multi-Year Training in Weight Lifting‑‑A. S. Medvedyev\nSuper Training‑‑Mel Siff\nFundamentals of Special Strength Training in Sport‑‑Y. V. Verkoshansky\nManaging the Training of Weight Lifters, N. P. Laputin‑‑V. G. Oleshko\nThis will help your education in weight lifting.\nLouie Simmons",

      "pageContent": "WESTSIDE FOR CROSSFIT Louie Simmons Mon Jun 06, 2016 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/IMG_2123_6b586413-fe1e-4bfe-b604-a9c415373186_720x.JPG?v=1563691381\" width=\"1036\" height=\"1036\" alt=\"WESTSIDE FOR CROSSFIT\"> Related Topics: Exercise Programming, General Physical Preparedness, Louie Simmons, Strength Training General Endurance\nA Crossfit athlete must have all special strength’s. Explosive strength for jumping, speed strength for the Olympic lifts strength speed for the deadlifts. Most important though is general endurance for simultaneous strength training.\nIn many ways Crossfit is a form of circuit training but some exercises are for endurance. Many are explosive strength like jumping and many are very heavy like deadlifting or pulling a very heavy sled across a football field, to doing hand stand pushups. So both strength and endurance must be improved simultaneously as well as increasing oxygen consumption as well as your anaerobic metabolism\nInjury Prevention\nStrength training builds not only muscular strength but also mechanical strength of the connective tissue, especially around the joints. For tendons and ligaments a strong muscle will absorb more energy than a weak muscle group. For weight training I recommend the Westside three week pendulum waves, going from 50% to 60% in a three week wave with 25% band tension at lockout.\n1st week – 12 sets of 2 reps2nd week – 12 sets of 2 reps3rd week – 10 sets of 2 reps\nRest intervals 45 seconds. If you squat 400lbs the weight ranges from 200lbs to 240lbs on the last week. This is 4,800lbs for squats. If you squat 300lbs your weights would be 150 – 180lbs. This math formula make it impossible to over train. Your deadlift could be trained the same way or the standing press or clean and snatch. For injury prevention only 20% of the weight training is with a barbell, 80% is with special exercises, mainly reverse hypers, leg press, shrugs and back extensions. A 400lb squatter should do roughly 16,000lbs of reverse hypers and 16,000lbs of leg pressing. These exercises work the body in single joint fashion which is much safer than high rep squats or deadlifts. This leaves time for chin-ups, jumps or upper body work like delt raises, front, side and rear. 10 sets of squats and 12 sets of deadlifts are done in around 20 minutes nonstop or 12 sets of cleans and 12 sets of snatches can be done in the same short time periods. Why so much attention on small exercises? To maintain proper muscle balance for prevention of injuries.\nBuilding General Fitness\nWhat is fitness? It is the ability to do every day activities much like a farmer or a manual laborer. Our style of lifting consist of pushing or pulling a strong man wheel barrow. The distance can vary greatly from 60 yards for football or any ball sports and including hockey. My experience with a third ranked Olympic triathlete was the same for endurance athletes she would warm up on a non-motorized treadmill or walking in a belt squat machine until her heart rate rose to 155 then a sled weighing 45lbs, 70lbs or 80lbs was pulled up to as much as 2½ miles or until her heart rate was 195 beats per minute. While the sled work increased her times on the bike, and running, swimming decreased constantly. This was her workout except for some triceps and pullovers. There are many methods to build running endurance but the sled is superior to all others. Power walk, never run, as running adds to momentum. With power walking each step is a start and it greatly reduces deceleration in all races from a 60meter to a marathon. Try pulling 45lbs or 90lbs on a sled while carrying a 40lb – 60lb medicine ball in your arms. This builds all endurance, muscular and oxygen consumption. A strong man yoke with different loads for a set distance ¼, ½ or one mile for a workout. This should be followed by jumping on to a box of low to moderate height for a 60 second drill. If you have a belt squat machine, walk in place for 1 up to 5 minutes with different weights for counting your steps. Also, carry a medicine ball while walking. By adding ankle weights or a Bulgarian bag of 20lbs up to 60lbs is a real test. More sled work calls for pushing a wheel barrow while pulling a sled behind.\nThe Zercher Lift\nLift a barbell held in your elbows off the ground for up to 20 reps, this is very tough but makes you ready for anything Crossfit can throw at you. To back up the zercher lift, do Ukrainian deadlifts. This is done with a kettlebell standing on two plyo boxes. High reps are in order for this one too. Lower the kettlebell as low as possible for a full stretch of the lower back, hamstrings and it also builds the abs. Even reps up to 100 is fine if your strength and fitness level will allow. A great workout is to attach a mini band or Bulgarian bag (20lbs up to 60lbs for the very strong) around your waist while doing your chin ups, or if you are too weak to do a chin up you can attach a band on top of the rack then place your foot in it to make a chin up or pull up possible until you are strong enough to do a real chin up or pull up. There is nothing wrong with doing barbell rows, dumbbell rows, low pulley or chest supported rows to build your pull ups, power cleans, snatch and deadlift. Up right rows are a very effective exercise to increase your pulling strength. Try pushing a prowler with an assortment of weight for different distances. Also, add ankle weights, weight vest or both for variety.\nMany Crossfit athletes come from a sport where circuit training was a main core of your training. This is common for wrestling. A common circuit would be dips for six reps then hurdle jumps for six reps, weighted sit ups for six reps, jumping squats for six reps, leg raises with weight for six reps and chin ups for six reps for example. This is for muscular endurance. A circuit can be done with machines, free weights and stretching as well. No rest between exercises. It is recommended to do 5 – 15 reps per station. Much like a Crossfit event where max strength and endurance is contested on the same day you can do a heavy set 80% – 90% for 2 – 4 reps then a light set of a different exercise for high reps 8 – 12 reps, this is certainly Crossfit to make yourself bullet proof. The small exercises like reverse hypers, back raises, high rep leg curls up to 200 a day and abs all the time will ensure your success for competing at the games.\nGood Luck!\nLouie Simmons",

You will learn what an Olympic cycle is and how it is broken into annual training cycles. You’ll also learn how to raise training results by using GPP to build greater techniques and a larger training base.\nWhat is the speed barrier and how does an athlete overcome it?\nThe speed barrier appears when the athlete learns to move at a certain rate and finds he cannot run any faster even with added strength or reaction time.\nThis is,of course, the law of accommodation that we find in the science and practice of strength training.\nHow is the problem solved?\nOne way is by having teammates or coaches encourage the athlete to perform better.\nThis should already be the case.\nThe second method is to stop doing sport-specific speed exercises and do directed and general speed, plus strength exercises.\nBy doing this the memory of performing running tasks in the same time will be forgotten.\nThe book addresses many, many questions that you should be interested in for getting the best results.\nWhen should children start strength training?\nWhat is sport-specific strength?\nWhat does directed strength training cover?\nThe athlete will learn how to develop speed as well as reaction time. This is. of course. most important for the athlete.\nTo build speed you must learn what exercises and activities to use for increasing sport-specific speed.\nWhat are rest intervals and what is active rest?\nDo you really know what endurance is?\nAnd what factors affect endurance training like pain, fear and motivation.\nHow do you increase endurance and when does one stop endurance training?\nHave you ever considered these factors?\nWhat is circuit training used for and how do you organize it?\nCan you learn coordination and find out how to stretch and build flexibility?\nDo you know what the flexibility reserve is?\nWhat are special strengths and how are they measured?\nIs it to build up the amount of weight lifted, or at a certain velocity.\nFrom this book you can learn how to apply tactics depending on your skills or lack of them and your opponents.\nHow do you build the ability to relax both mentally and physically through general psychological training like providing motivation.\nDo introverts train like extroverts or differently?\nThis book tells all and much more.\nMany times Westside is asked for a six to eight or 12-week training plan, but training should be a long term plan that is broken up into a daily, weekly, monthly plan that grows into a yearly and multiyear plan.\nBy doing this type of planning you can measure the changes in improving all physical tasks.\nWhen does one know they are overtrained? What are the tests? How do you correct it?\nHow long between extreme workouts as well as medium and small workouts?\nHow do you measure physical abilities?\nWhat is the difference between anaerobic and aerobic fitness?\nThere are many forms of fitness including neuromuscular fitness. How do you test them?\nCan the athlete pass a psychological test that considers group cohesion and mood states?\nMuch of my knowledge about the science applied to different sports came from this book by Thomas Kurz.\nI took for granted in the beginning that there was only one type of strength, and endurance was just that.\nTo excel at coaching you must have a vast amount of experience and then combine it with practical knowledge gained from books just like Science of Sports Training.\nI personally will always be indebted to men like Thomas Kurz for publicizing this fine book and others.\nLouie Simmons",

Mel was a good friend and an expert on biomechanics. Mel was a huge fan of Westside and Westside was a huge fan of Mel. He is known mostly for Supertraining, but a lesser known book Facts and Fallacies of Fitness is a must for all coaches and trainers. As the title points out, sometimes it is hard to tell the difference without a lot of years’ experience. You may find that you are doing yourself and your clients more harm than good.This book can help one become a competent personal trainer. Is ballistics dangerous? Is there a real need to warm-up? Should you hold your breath while exercising? Do squats damage your knees? Remember, as they say, a little knowledge is dangerous, and many internet geniuses don’t have that much known age, yet have a huge fan base.\nYou will learn that while cardio is pushed far more than strength and agility training, the simple fact is strength and agility is much more important. Without strength you have nothing. Having weak muscles and ligaments and tendons are why we have an epidemic of joint replacements. Too many people learn about strength training from body building magazines. There is a difference between just increasing hypertrophy for body building opposed to weightlifting or powerlifting.\nThere are many contradictory statements concerning strength and fitness, but Mel breaks it down between a fact or a fallacy in a way that is understandable. Many rejected the Soviets and their sport training due to political reasons rather than to sports science.The NSCA. provides very low level basic knowledge of sport training. In the former Soviet Union one could earn a degree for coaching; this is not the case in the United States. Only Westside Barbell offers a coaching degree. Oh, by the way, it has an 85 percent failure rate thanks to Dr. Mel Siff.\nThe answers to such questions as “Does weightlifting increase blood pressure?”, “Is touching your toes dangerous?”, “Does heavy weight training hurt your speed and flexibility?”, “Should you push your stomach in or out to stabilize your truck?”, “What is a max effort and can it be done more than once?”, “Are straight leg sit-ups dangerous?”, and “Is PNF stretching really a stretch?” are provided.\nThere is much more to think about if you are to become a top coach or trainer: Do sit-ups make your waist smaller? Are Goodmornings dangerous? Should you lock the knees at the end of a squat? Is a stationary bike as good as a real bicycle? Is running on a treadmill the same as running on a track or road? There are countless questions like this without solid answers.\nIs it safe to have women do high weight training like weight lifting or powerlifting? Do you know the definition of fitness? What is OPP. and is it useful for the weight or powerlifting? Have you thought about when you stop endurance training? Are there different types of muscle fiber and if so which is best for a sprint or a marathon? What is best for each?\nAnd consider these: How does one test top strength potential? Is an irregular heart unhealthier? What is oxygen belt? Which is safer, a flat back or a rounded back? Does connective tissue grow strength at the same rate as muscle tissue? How do you correct pelvic tilt?\nJust when you think you have all the answers, Dr. Siff changes questions. Rowdy Roddy Piper would say this as a pro wrestler as he was kicking your ass. The same with Dr. Siff. Can electric stim produce great or a greater muscle contraction on your own?\nThere are so many questions without answers that a must-read book is the Facts and Fallacies of Fitness. It covers fitness and special strength as well as why athletes from nations such as China and Jamaica as well as Kenya are so good at a special sporting event.I am sure you will enjoy this book by my old colleague Dr. Mel Siff. -Louie",

He started at 16-years-old at the 52 kg class lifting raw. He placed 12th at the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) European Championship. It was a disappointing beginning but he was determined to reach the top of powerlifting.\nAt 19, he was back at the Worlds and this time he was the world champion at 56 kg in the junior division. At this championship, his lifts were 374, 242, and 374. This Winning meant a lot to Gerry, but his father was so proud of Gerry he put his gold medal around his neck to show his friends downtown. This made Gerry the first Irishman to ever win a world powerlifting championship. This happened in Norway in 1987.\nFor the next five years, Gerry was in limbo. Gerry found, like I did, that as he got older, he got a lot smarter and did his best lift after 40- years- old. After that five-year span of no progress, he began to use the Westside System. Now That he was world champ again while breaking the European record and he won the Champion of Champions Best Lifter award.\nNot content in 1993, Gerry won the IPF World Games in Germany while setting European and World records. Gerry, along with two of his training partners, traveled from Ireland to Columbus, Ohio to visit Westside and talk training with Louie, me and the Westside gang. After the trip, Andy Fogarty and Sam Graham gave a pair of Patterdale Terriers to Chuck V. Those dogs were off the hook. I remember that visit like it was yesterday, even though it was 22 years ago.\nWe talked about all of Westside’s special training methods like percent training for speed strength, M-E workouts, contrast training with chains and bands, volume and intensities special exercises, and wave pendulum loading along with delayed transformation. Gerry and I are brothers from different mothers. We share the same goal of proving there are no limits.\nEight years after coming to Westside, Gerry made a historic lift squatting 903 at 72 kg, but he bombed on the bench and that organization would not count the record. But this did not stop Gerry from setting the world record at 148 weighing 67.4 kg. He made 806.9 – his all-time best. Now at 52- years- old, Gerry lifted on April 2016 and made 340 kg 749 at 60 kg. That was 5.7 times his body weight and totaled over 12 times his body weight. Yes, the second squat was a new world record.\nGerry has a resume like no other … 57 world records with three all-time world records, 67 European records along with 127 Irish records while winning 22 World Championships in every federation on this planet. Gerry is a sponsored athlete – sponsored by Titan since 1985. This in itself shows how loyal Gerry is. Not only is Gerry one of the greatest powerlifters of all-time, but an exceptional lifting and sports coach. His athletes are from the United States, South Africa, Finland, and of course, Ireland. His Westside certified gym – the only one in Ireland – has produced at least 20 world champions who have broken not only national records, but European and world records, along with one all-time world record.\nWhen Gerry is not competing, he travels around the world to coach or referee, and most of the time on his own money. Because Gerry knows that I don’t travel, he comes to Westside as often as he can. There can never be anyone more determined and with such integrity toward Westside Barbell as Gerry McNamara. He knows what a true Westsider is … and that is what defines Gerry as a true brother in every sense of the Westside way.\nLong Live King Gerry.\nLouie Simmons\nWestside Rules\n* PS – thanks to Jennifer Milliron for much of this info.",

Do not train the clean and snatch in the same session due to different coordination structures. Therefore, you must use special pulls that can be used not only more often, but with maximal weights.\nThis is fully explained on page 76 in Laputin and Oleshko’s book Managing the Training of Weightlifters. First look at A.S. Prilepin’s data from 1974. Prilepin was the junior national coach and the senior national coach for Russia.\nLet’s look at the optimal and maximal number of lifts in one workout.\nAt: 70% 18 and 24 lifts 80% 15 and 20 lifts 90% 7 and 10 lifts\nWe know that to improve your clean or snatch you must raise volume. But how?\nIf you look at Prilepin’s data one must stop at the optimal or for the very well trained the maximal number of lifts. Surpassing the recommended number of lifts leads to the barbell becoming too slow or technique will suffer. The answer is special exercises.\nA weightlifter must reach two goals. Becoming faster meaning speed strength and becoming stronger meaning absolute strength. The goal is to constantly raise the average intensity meaning a percent of a 1 rep max (rm). To do this it is impossible to do with only the classical lifts.\nThis leads to a series of special pulls. Choose an arsenal of special pulls that work best for you. A popular one for top weightlifters from China, Russia, and Bulgaria is the snatch grip deadlift. This is a main exercise for the Chinese. Coach Fang says to pull as heavy as possible even if your back rounds or until you cannot get the barbell off the ground. Remember this comes from the Chinese Coach Fang.\nThree methods can be tested. One is to start the pull with the feet on the floor. The second, is to start with the lifter standing on an elevated platform. The third is to pull with rubber bands over the barbell. You should choose at least three different band tensions. This is accommodating resistance. It makes it possible to change bar velocity while making it possible to break new max efforts while you are stuck with only one mount of limit strength.\nPower Clean\nPlace a barbell on boxes to start the pull at mid shin, just below the knee, just above the knee, and at the top of the thigh. Use just barbell weight or one can use weight and bands of three strengths. One should use a variety of grips such as a regular clean grip or a wider than normal clean grip.\nA weightlifter must do M-E work. Remember the weight on the barbell and the barbell’s speed are inversely proportional. As the barbell becomes heaver the speed of the barbell slows. When doing special exercises for weightlifting this has no ill effect on timing, coordination, or technique.\nThere are 100 special exercises for the weightlifter as shown in “A System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting” by A.S. Medvedyev. If special pulls are important how can you increase strength to raise special pulls? Back raises, Reverse Hypers, Calf Ham Glute raises, Inverse leg curls, Good mornings, shrugs and upright rows. The Chinese do two body building exercises after every training session. Do not forget jumping with weight in hands, barbell on the back or held on the chest. This will make training much more enjoyable and much more productive.\nRemember if you want to improve the classical lifts you must improve the power clean and power snatch. Isometrics can be a positive tool for the weightlifter. For pulls use six starting positions. This will increase absolute strength. The average USA weightlifter has adequate technique, but falls behind in absolute strength. This can be easily changed by adding to your volume while increasing the average intensity through special exercises.\nMany coaches used special assistance exercises to be assessed in training to raise GPP. Two individuals who stressed this were M.P. Mikhailov and R.A. Roman. Louie Simmons",

I found him to be the most knowledgeable man about sprinting with whom I have ever had a conversation with. He was in the United States after an exhausting trip that finally landed him and his family in Baltimore.\nHis start in track was sprinting and he was very fast. He had his own ideas on how to sprint, and wanted to prove it. First he obtained a Ph.D. in Physical Education and Sport Science, plus a Master’s in Biology. He came to the United States because he could go no further in the Soviet Union. He was Jewish and never joined the Soviet Union.\nHe was very creative, but that made little difference under his circumstances. He wanted to teach speed to sprinters. Thank goodness Frank Costello was the strength coach at the University of Maryland and made it possible for Ben to talk at a seminar in Memphis, Tenn. All the coaches were overwhelmed and he got a chance, after all that is what he wanted to prove that he had a system that would make someone run faster.\nI am writing about Ben, who died in May 2008, to thank him and many other Russian Sport Scientists that made it possible to formulate the Westside System. Ben’s goal was to have a system to use for the one’s who do not take drugs.\nDrugs or no drugs, his concepts on the training of a youth to Elite athlete is a guide-line from which to teach. Ben had many training innovations one of which was the speed-chute. He saved this device until arriving in the United States.\nIt seems to me that the difference between philosophy of the United States and the Soviet Union was the United States looks for a better athlete, and the Soviet Union looked for a better training system to make a better athlete. In the book Soviet Training and Recovery Methods Ben takes the reader through the greatest training methodologies ever devised.\nTwo things come to mind first, a large amount of money was spent on the training of their coaches and athletes. This is not the case in the USA. It may appear to many that are consumed by professional sports, but do not look at the athletes, rather the coaches. Many have not tried to educate themselves past their college degrees. One should be equally equipped to coach a 10-year-old as a pro.\nThe Soviet Union would have their youth go to a sport school to determine what sport one should enter by the evaluations undertaken at the school. This is referred to as the Rule of Three. After the three years of GPP they are entered into a sport that is best suited for the child by their physical abilities as well as their psychological state.\nYou will learn that the Soviet Union had two degrees, one for teaching and one for coaching. Westside is attempting to do the same in the USA. Students can only receive teaching. Like the Soviet Union, Westside has a coaching certificate that is very extensive consisting of 12 or so books and many hours of DVDs.\nMost sport training starts at nine to 10 years-of-age and every two years they must progress at a certain rate. At 19 to 21 they are considered to be a polished athlete or they’re basically retired. The top young athletes go on to the top sport clubs like the military team or the Dynamo club. It was a way out of poverty to be a top athlete. Many could make more per month than a Ph.D. in Physics or Medicine. Today it is not that much different in the USA with paid college fees and non-college athletes with numerous sponsorships. The key to success is a long-term plan. Remember they start at nine or 10, so at 20 years old they have 10 years of sustained efforts at one sport. Then their sports career begins. Be sure not to push the young athlete too fast, or they could burn out far from reaching their upmost potential. This happens in the US far too often. A lesson to be learned for sure.\nThe Soviets had so many researchers, but no way to get the information to all the other coaches. There is a different problem in the USA. There is no connection between science and team coaches. Ben talks about the importance of top coaches and trainers in all sports. A country needs to put its entire effort into teams that will excel in specific sports, and not waste time on certain sports that they will have little chance of winning.\nAll training methods must blend together including restoration and pharmaceuticals. This is not the case here. The West has no such plan for training an eight-year-old up to maybe 32-years-old. This leads to a lack of preparation from beginning to the end of a sports career. The parent will always choose the education path for their kids, but not their sports career. This, of course, will lead to a lack of preparation.\nLike Ben found, there are many methods of training for a given sport by many coaches. But Westside, like Ben, knows there is only two ways to train. The right way or the wrong way. From basic drills, to weight training or plyometrics the training is at least 30 years behind the Russian Training methods. Too often the coaches in the USA train for strength like bodybuilders. This system builds muscle mass, but not any special strengths. Remember, big ain’t strong, strong is strong. Westside has preached this since 1988. This was six years after I started using the Soviet training. The Soviet training calls for bringing all special strengths along with technique. Technique is important, but there are other factors to account for.\nWhen one talks about training restoration it must play a large role in the development in a sports career. Ben shows that the training of top athletes must be planned carefully. It is easy to make progress early in one’s career. But when at the top to make greater progress it must be planned carefully. Training volume must be raised throughout the athlete’s career. Also intensity must be raised as well, but most important is the correct exercises. The body will adapt to the more rigorous training.\nBen talked about choosing the best special exercises for the right athlete. You will find that weight training builds a large amount of base strength and jumping, not Olympic lifting, builds explosive strength.\nThere is so much information I cannot begin to talk about everything that is covered in this fine book. It is hard to find and expensive, up to $600, but if you canfind a copy, I highly suggest you buy it. You will see why it costs so much. It is worth it.\nLouie Simmons",

Medvedyev Louie Simmons Tue Feb 09, 2010 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/A_System_of_Multi-Year_Training_in_Weightlifting_ffff6cd1-934f-4ceb-914a-b4b8ae1fa613_720x.png?v=1563691353\" width=\"1691\" height=\"2048\" alt=\"A System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting by A.S. Medvedyev\"> Related Topics: Book Review, Exercise Programming, Strength Training Methods, Training Methods & Techniques As you should know by now, the Westside system is adapted from the systematic research of the Soviet Union’s track and field and weightlifting methodologies. There was no powerlifting research when I was starting out. I soon found, however, that one does not train for a single meet, but rather trains for a long-range goal, which takes a long-term plan. For all of you ‘weightlifter only’ people out there, A System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting is a must read.\nThis Book is about amassing a large training plan that takes an athlete from 10 years old or younger through to adulthood. The plan addresses sport-technical mastery by introducing special training plans. From there the young sportsman goes through developmental training that becomes more demanding every two years.\nForty percent of the training is for General Physical Preparedness (GPP). One cannot just try to increase the two classical lifts; this can disrupt that weightlifter’s long-term goal. While in the early years, the work on the snatch/clean and jerk (C-J) is raised until a high level of sports mastery is achieved.\nThen, even more GPP – about 20 percent – is included into the program, which is designed to increase strength by raising total volume. It takes about four years of training to reach a high level at weightlifting. Special exercises comprise a large portion of that training to build speed-strength. To improve technical work the Soviets would raise the requirement to reach master of sport. It seems that the United States has made it easier to reach a total to lift in our nationals.\nMedvedyev found that in long-term training, the larger weightlifter could continue to make progress longer then the lighter lifters. That is one reason light lifters do not want to gain weight. This was found to be a mistake. The longevity can be prolonged by the advancement of new training methods and special equipment, much like the equipment at Westside Barbell.\nWhen a lifter goes up a weight class, he or she can expect to gain an average of 30 kg. The book also states that the lifter can prolong their progress sometimes by three years or as much as six or seven years to 10 years. It takes a program that uses many special means to increase that volume in the correct intensity zones that will improve sport-technical mastery. This is done by using special programs consisting of many special exercises that are constantly rotated.\nTo reach the top, you must go through many stages that increase technical styles by working on a lagging muscle group while adding volume in all intensity zones in an organized plan. It does no good to have highly qualified specialists lay out a plan that cannot be implemented by a sub-par coach. Many lifters let the coach lay out a program that is mostly worthless. Bud Charniga Jr. made many books available to the coaches, and when talking to them they said they read them … but did they? I don’t think so. Many of the books by Bud say the same thing. But you must be able to absorb what you read when you are responsible for others.\nNext, the conjugate system was first used on beginners in four-week programs. It was later found that a more individualized program must take place. By 1971, Medvedyev began a plan for 24 weeks of loading for the highest skilled lifters to increase tonnage with attention to selecting what special exercises to use for a certain lifter. The task was taken on by A. S. Prilepin, the junior Soviet Union coach from 1975 to 1980 and the senior national coach from 1980 to 1985.\nPrilepin had found the minimum optimal and maximal amount of lifts and reps per workout that allowed the lifter to optimally use proper bar speed while maintaining correct technical skills. But a new problem surfaced … how to add volume. The answer? Special exercises for improving the squat and pulls and jerks.\nSpecial exercises took the form of overcoming yielding combination exercises for muscle work including isometric work. This made training much better, and much more interesting while raising work capacity. This was done first at the Dynamo Club. The conjugate system allows one to work on what is needed to improve. Everyone does not have the same strengths or weaknesses. This program takes into account this fact.\nOne must improve year by year. The program must change to improve. This is the conjugate system. Prilepin and Medvedyev are responsible for at least 100 different weightlifting snatch and C-J exercises. This is much like my programs in my strength manual for weightlifting. Many ‘weightlifter only’ people will constantly ask me “can only weightlifters use the conjugate system?” I hope A System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting and other books we sell that were translated by Charniga will help educate the weightlifting community.\nOf course, this book covers biomechanical fundamentals of the technique of the snatch and clean. It tells the importance of doing special exercises from many positions, including standing on a raised platform. It shows the most effective special exercises for the jerk. Jerk behind the head\nJerk from stands or pin\nClassical C-J\nPush jerk\nWide-grip jerk\nHalf jerk You will learn what weightlifting exercises to start with and how to progress to strength exercises later. And why you must do at least 50 percent of your training aimed toward strength development. You’ll also, learn how to separate special strengths, and find out what special strengths are, including speed strength, explosive strength, slow or strength speed, and isometric strength. We all must learn to train correctly. Train like knowing what a contest max is, and a training max – and when to use each. You will learn that it is common knowledge that the key quality of a weightlifter is strength … that’s right, strength.\nThis shows that while speed is a must, so is being able to display a maximum effort like the Westside’s Pendulum Wave system of loading in a three-week wave. It says one should constantly vary the amount of weight lifted for optimum progress. And the importance of jumping exercises. You will learn the importance of raising the average intensity in all lifts – special and classical. This is a must to increase your total every year of your sporting career.\nA.S. Medvedyev shows that by lowering the intensity, your lift will go down. He also shows that while beginners train four times a week, as you move up in training you must add more workouts. For strength and raising GPP, you should have mastered technique by now.\nLearn to organize the training by first a weekly plan that turns into a monthly plan, and of course, a yearly plan that becomes a multi-year plan. Like Westside that has too many special exercises to mention, Medvedyev constantly shows countless lifts and programs to increase strength in certain portions of the body that can raise the classical lifts. To reach the top in weightlifting, it requires a large amount of strength work and a larger amount of energy.\nYou will find the most important exercises and how often to train. Then, don’t do worthless exercises, and above all, check to make sure your training is aimed at improving your total – and not just providing you with a program.",

We often refer to the Reverse Hyper as the corner stone of training, and more often than not, anyone that has trained on the Hyper agrees with us. Like the Dual Pendulum Reverse Hyper that we spoke bout a couple weeks ago, the Ultra Supreme features the adjustable table top. This feature offers more versatility for training. By tilting the front of the table top down we are able to place greater emphasis on the low back and achieve greater traction. By tilting it up, we can recruit the glutes and hamstrings into the movement more. We often condone performing repetitions on the Westside Barbell Reverse Hypers numerous times throughout the week in a variety of ways, as there is nothing but strength and increased health to be gained from doing so, but where to start? Lou recommends the following: Early in the week (Max Effort Lower Body Day) perform 4 sets of 10 at a weight equal to 50% of your squat. For a second workout later in the week (Dynamic Lower Day) perform up to four sets of 20 Reverse Hypers at a weight around 25% percent of your 1RM squat. These two Reverse Hyper workouts should function as a starting point and be built upon. It is important to keep accessory work difficult, and to not place limits on your reps and sets simply for the sake of doing so. Keep your work on the Ultra Supreme Reverse Hyper DIFFICULT and your progress in the squat and dead lift will show. DO NOT be afraid of performing heavy reps on our machine. A balance of light an heavy reps must be performed. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Users can get so much out of the Dual Pendulum that I find myself hesitant to speak on the piece, in fear of degrading the benefits and efficacy the other Westside Barbell Reverse Hypers offer…. but here we go! This week we are not aiming at the big picture of the patented Reverse Hyper, we are discussing the training and rehabilitative benefits of the Dual Pendulum, only! Starting from the top of the Dual Pendulum we have an adjustable table top; offering 15 degrees of “tilt” both down and up. By placing the back of the pad in the UP position the user can place greater emphasis on the low back and erectors, while still recruiting the glutes, hamstrings, and abdominals into the movement. By tilting the back (side closest to the user) of the platform down, we shift gears and place the glutes and hamstrings in the primary mover position. As we move our way down the piece we will notice the split pendulum. This feature allows users to insert the retention pins into the pendulum for use as a single pendulum (both legs at the same time) OR remove the pins and move each leg individually. By training each leg separate we can tailor training for a number of needs: -Running, strengthen and rehab the posterior chain in a “mocked” running stride. -Address bilateral deficiencies, in the erector spinae, as well as hip alignment. -Correct muscle imbalance, as we all have a dominant side due to sport or injury there are instances where the left or right side of the body may need to be worked independent of the other. Continuing to the foot rollers. If the athlete chooses to use the rollers, we again place greater emphasis on the low back. So coupling rollers, with the elevated platform the low back is exercised at the highest intensity level offered by the machine, The rollers + table top position mentioned, also offer the greatest traction possible on the Dual Pendulum Reverse Hyper. Also included with each Dual Pendulum is a pair of straps that the user can utilize in place of the detachable rollers. These straps place a greater emphasis on the glutes and hamstrings, which in turn will reduce the effort on the low back. We have seen the straps serve as a tremendous starting point for users with substantial low back / spinal issues. By using the straps in conjunction with the table top in the “downward” position athletes can safely train the glutes and hamstrings under a heavier load than they might have used on other models. By keeping the table top neutral, or flat, we are able to pull from the same benefits developed by Louie Simmons decades ago, and again straps for glutes / hams, rollers for low back. As a five year veteran of law enforcement I can speak first hand of the benefits of not only the Reverse Hyper, but the Dual Pendulum specifically, as it is reported that over 60% of LEO suffer from low back pain associated with the rigors of the job. On top of that as a strength coach, primarily in the world of MMA, we often see a deficit in low back strength based on fighting stance, as we look at the execution of a punch or kick the fighter must pivot on the rear leg. Coaches…. If you have a south paw suffering from low back pain there is a good chance his left erector is substantially stronger than the right and for a righty the right erector is probably stronger than the left. Thousands of strikes thrown in training and competition throughout the months and years of a fighter’s career will yield these imbalances, and should be addressed. Not only to increase the striking power of the off hand, but to also prolong with well being of the fighter! We strongly suggest you consider adding a Westside Barbell Dual Pendulum to your schools, and gyms With this one machine coaches and athletes alike can execute: Flat Top: Downward Top: Upward Top: Double Rollers Double Rollers Double Rollers Double Strap Double Strap Double Strap Single Leg Rollers Single Leg Rollers Single Leg RollersSingle Leg Straps Single Leg Straps Single Leg Straps Alternating Rollers Alternating Rollers Alternating Rollers Alternating Straps Alternating Straps Alternating Straps There is no arguing the efficacy of the Westside Barbell Reverse Hyper, and if you are reading this it is assumed that our readers believe in the science behind it.

There is only a pair of strong hamstrings and weak hamstrings. Regardless of your preference in stance (close or wide) if your hamstrings are weak, your squat (and deadlift) probably aren't on par. Now that I have gotten that out of my system, we can continue discussing the tools necessary to train the hamstrings!\nThis week we are introducing the Westside Barbell Standing Hamstring Curl Machine. Why did Westside spend the time and money developing such a simple piece? As with all of our other signature pieces, necessity is the catalyst for creation. Hamstring curls are not the cornerstone of hamstring training, as we mentioned last week while discussing the Inverse Curl, but they do serve their purpose in strengthening the hamstrings.\nUnlike other models on the market, the Westside Barbell Standing Hamstring Curl Machine allows the user to begin the reps in a variety of starting positions. By “kicking” the foot back anywhere from 2” - 6” and executing the curl we can change the range of motion and add a layer of difficulty that isn't available on other inferior models.\nRepetitions can also be performed in a more traditional position by keeping the heel and hip in a straight vertical line. Users can keep he leg completely straight, and move a short distance forward and back to stretch the hip flexors prior to training, (face both forward and backward, left and right for variety.)\nWhen we added a standing hamstring curl machine to the floor at Westside we observed a gradual increase in pulling strength in the deadlift that coincided with the increase in volume on the standing hamstring curl. We've also seen improvements in our sprinters, in both time and technique. On top of these performances, we noticed a substantial DECREASE in hamstring injuries. Though serious hamstring injuries are rare at Westside Barbell, the occasional “stinger” or strain do occur, the occurrences have become few and far between since implementation of the standing hamstring curl.\nAfter using the piece we began to see areas that could be improved during use, and went straight to work on having the NEW Westside Barbell Standing Hamstring Curl Machine designed! Another outstanding use of the piece is to add variety to mini-workouts, as you are all well aware of Louie and everyone that trains here are huge advocates for high rep hamstring curls with ankle weights and/or bands.\nChanging it up to the Westside Barbell Standing Hamstring Curl Machine will again allow us to avoid accommodation and progress faster toward our speed and strength goals. Strive for 200 reps per leg, per week. Available now for only $850.00 this simple, and inexpensive, addition to your training facility is sure to add performance increases to any and all that use it! <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

I always look at the Inverse Curl as a means to work through a simple 1-10 scale… 1 being unable to perform a Glute Ham Raise properly, and 10 being able to perform Glute Ham Raises with added weight for multiple reps. No One can go from a 1 to a 10 without the practice and a means to get there. Enter the Westside Barbell Inverse Curl.\nThe Inverse Curl allows us to complete steps 2 through 8, as maintaining proper form and hip alignment is imperative for progress. Hips back kipping GHRs do little to no good for the athlete.\nFor beginners, or athletes with terribly weak hamstrings: Place the athlete’s knees on the middle of the knee pad with the ankles locked securely into the adjustable rollers. The roller/kick plate apparatus should be placed at the appropriate position so the user does not “crowd” the front of the knee pad. Then load the counterweight peg with the user’s body weight or slightly above. (The heavier the peg, the lighter the rep.) This will allows the user to “feel” the range of motion and will cause them to better understand the execution. Place the chest pad, at a setting above the user’s sternum, while simultaneously ensuring the arch in the back is maintained. There should be no rounding at anytime during the set. For Advanced Users\nI recommend “exploring the machine” meaning variety! The Inverse Curl Machine is only one machine, but it can perform many functions. Adjust he kick plate so the user’s knees are in different locations on the knee pad. You will be surprised how having the front of the thigh forward or back even an inch changes the difficulty. Add or remove weight from the peg. After using the Inverse Curl Machine with moderate weight, and dropping to 20% of the body weight or less you will begin to feel what a real Glute Ham Raise should feel like, and why the Inverse Curl is so effective! Use the ankle rollers open and closed, locking the ankles in will place serious tension on the hamstrings, while leaving them open will cause greater muscle recruitment in the calves and lower hamstring. You can also perform reps with the heels on the kick plate only, and recruit more glute/hamstring over calf. Place the hands under the chest roller or on top. The execution of the rep and range of motion will not change, but the firing patterns and muscles will, causing a greater adaption and greater results in performance.\nExecution of the exercise To perform the rep, be it a standard repetition or any variation listed or not listed, after setting up. Maintain the arch of the back while “hinging” at the knee.\nMaintain intra-abdominal pressure, as well as tension in the upper back, throughout the ROM and lower the head and torso,\nbegin by striving for parallel, then the second that is accomplished go lower until the head is less than an inch from the deck. To complete the concentric portion of the inverse curl, begin contracting each muscle group in the posterior chain one by one, beginning with the calves, then hamstrings, glutes, and finally the erectors by keeping the chin elevated throughout execution. Move through the exercise quickly, but under control… If you feel that you are losing the arch in the back, or have started kicking the hips back have a partner add additional weight to the peg in order to complete the set with proper form. Once the user can perform four sets of 15 perfect reps, make a change in execution and reintroduce a means of difficulty in order to avoid accommodation. With all of that said, users can stay in the down position of the exercise as well and contract the glutes while using a shorter ROM to focus on glutes and upper hamstrings. This is a tremendous variation for ball players, or any athlete that needs a powerful ass on them!\nFor strength training strive for two workouts a week minimum on the Westside Barbell Inverse Curl. If the hamstrings are the weak link in the squat or deadlift perform Inverse Curls immediately following your main movement, This day should be difficult, but not terribly high in volume. On Dynamic Day, perform higher rep sets for multiple sets, and / or superset another exercise for the legs.\nRemember for accessory work, do not adhere to a specific rep / set prior to training. As Louie says, “If your accessory work is hard, it’s working.” Keep training hard, and your PRs will reflect and improve.\nTo summarize the Westside Barbell Inverse Curl Machine simply makes athletes better! The firing pattern of the muscles perfectly mimics athletics, be it the lower body while throwing, sprinting, lifting, or jumping. We have seen nothing, but tremendous results with this piece.Faster pitching in baseball, stronger baller players, heavier (and faster) cleans / snatches, stronger squats, harder punches, and FASTER sprints! The list goes on and on. Coaches and gym owners should perceive the addition of the Westside Barbell Inverse Curl Machine an investment in training quality, not the purchase of a new machine. At $2595.00 ($2995.00 with storage) you will truly reap the rewards of your efforts! <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Many know Yuri as an early researcher in the field of plyometric training and other shock methods of training (as on page 282 in Supertraining). Many of these methods are used on Maximum Effort (M-E) day at Westside. This makes him the most recognized scientist in the field of explosive strength training. He was a true expert in the theory of not only the conjugate-sequence system, but also the long delay training effect, special physical preparation, the methodology of special strength training, and the block training system. His ideas of periodization as a major concept of training led Tudor Bompa to say, “if periodized training is ineffective, what is there left to us? We either have periodization or chaos.” His early ideas on training made it possible to take 12 non-athlete students and made it possible to become masters of sport. Yuri was awarded the highest coaching honor and the top honors a sports scientist can receive. He worked on all types of sports … from skiing, boxing, weightlifting, and all sports in between. Like Westside, his experiments were with the highest skilled athletes. So, you must pay close attention to the volume of training and the associated intensities – meaning, to start easy at first and work up to an optimal training program. In this manual, you will learn: His methodological findings on the subject of special strength training.\nHow to improve the athlete’s skill, as well as increasing motor skill potential.\nHow to increase sport skill by raising power output in main sporting tasks.\nHis ideas of special strength preparation like the dynamic method, M-E training, interval training, isokinetic work, isometric exercises.\nThe repeated effort method and many more like the shock training, static dynamic method, and the quasi isometric to name a few. This manual shows many jumping exercises with and without resistance. It shows how to build all types of endurance and strength training like explosive, speed, and strength speed training. It also shows how to warm up and how to overcome plateaus. If you want to increase your field events, this manual shows just how to do it. Yuri shows how to perform depth jumps correctly, to avoid injuries. You will learn how to connect strength training to increase sporting results while gaining technical mastery. Yuri shows how to use the conjugate-sequence system for all sports. After all, to be a high skilled athlete, may it be boxing, ball sports, track and field training, one must learn the conjugate system to find weaknesses and to make training more enjoyable to stimulate the mental training as well as the physical training for the athlete. It shows what box height works for explosive strength and at what height the box will build absolute strength. Westside uses mostly weighted jumps upward measured by a calculation known as momentum impulse. Westside uses 40 jumps for most athletes, two times a week – much like the volume for depth jumps. His idea of a training method using the athlete’s body weight falling through space from a pre-determined height. The falling body becomes kinetic energy (K-E) developed on the eccentric amortization phase, followed by an active concentric work. By looking at his work on kinetic energy and strength processes, I thought “how can I improve K-E?” The answer … by using band tension on the barbell. Yuri did a great job in making me think on how to improve training. Many are familiar with the special strength training manual for coaches and the fundamentals of special strength. But also special strength training, programming and organization of training quickness and velocity in sports movement, as well as the path to a scientific theory and methodology of sports training. What one can learn from this giant in the sports world is unmeasurable. If you want to have an edge, try Special Strength Training Manual for Coaches by Yuri and Natalia Verkhoshansky.",

Now serving as a professor at Pennsylvania State University, he received a Ph.D. in biomechanics from the Central Institute of Physical Culture in Russia.\nHe has memberships in the International Society of Biomechanics, American Society of Biomechanics, American Academy of Kinesiology and Physical Education, American College of Sports Medicine, and the Motor Control Society.\nHe also has scientific advisory over 70 Ph.D. dissertations and has publicized over 350 scientific papers, plus 19 patents and 15 books. This makes Dr. Zatsiorsky a giant in the world of special strength development.\nManaging the Training of Weight Lifters, the 1982 book by N.P. Laputin and V.G. Oleshko first gave a plan for organizing training, meaning periodization. But before that it was A. S. Prilepin’s Charts of Loads that lead to regulating volume and intensity. Then, Supertraining by Yuri Verkhoshansky led me to wave-style periodization and to perfect it for meet day. Science and Practice of Strength Training discuss delayed transformation.\nWhen hand training is going on, it is most difficult to reach the highest standard for two reasons. One, it is hard to fully adapt to the training effects. Second, one must counter fatigue that is caused by the high volume of training inside the weekly plan. To reach the highest possible results at meet time, one must taper the training starting 21 days out from a meet; at 14 days out you reduce squat to 75 percent; at seven days out to 50 percent for men under 110kg; over 110kg will do only small special exercises. This system came from Soviet track and field, Soviet weight lifting, and Bulgarian weight lifting.\nNext, Delayed Transmutation with a Twist While delayed transmutation is intended to stop training a lift all together and to do many large barbell exercises and small special exercises on mostly benches of special machines, you should start doing the lift again in a month or two. At Westside, 80 percent of our training is on special exercises and 20 percent on the classical lifts. We push up all special exercises, but maintain the training on the classical lift. This allows us to gain strength in a lacking muscle group with special exercises, which are rotated on a mostly weekly basis. The extreme training is spaced 72 hours apart with small workouts every 12 to 24 hours.\nThe Theory of Adaptation The theory of adaptation means one will adapt to the environment they are placed in. Two things a lifter must possess – speed and strength. At Westside on Fridays we do squat workouts where speed strength is trained. One hundred squats a month is performed along with doing 60 to 80 speed pulls. This is intermediate velocity for speed strength. Seventy-two hours later a Maximum Effort (M-E) workout is done. The bar velocity is slow including zero velocity when isometrics are done. The volume on M-E workouts is very low ranging from 30 percent to 35 percent of the dynamic workout. Our intention is to lift a weight as fast as possible or as heavy or slow as possible. Our training is to adapt to both velocities.\nThese are types of adaptation: Stimulus magnitude or overload – meaning one to increase volume in the correct intensity zones.\nConstantly finding ways to break new barriers – to adapt to training is to never completely adapt to specialized training. This is done by changing special exercises on a regular basis, as well as the volume and intensity. Remember, the difference in volume from dynamic day and an M-E day as well as the intensity zones.\nSpecificity – one must raise sport specific skills. This must be done early in the athlete’s career. There is no need to be strong in the wrong exercises.\nIndividualization – the coach or athlete must realize the special needs on not only the events the athlete will compete in, but also selecting the current loads in correct intensities for their sport. Theory of Overload How does one increase their work load – meaning volume? If you remember A. S. Prilepin’s data of the number of classical lifts in intensity zones, the most reps at 70 percent is six, at 80 percent is four, and at 90 percent is two. Why? The bar speed would be too slow and form would break. So how can one overload? The answer is special exercises like pulls, presses, and squats, plus small special exercises. This is shown in a System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting by A. S. Medvedev. The book was his study with Y. V. Verkhoshansky of the conjugate system. Why not raise classical exercises? Technique will suffer, but it does not matter when using general exercises. They have no ill effect on timing, coordination, or flexibility. This is the only way to increase total volume. The men at Westside will do 150,000 pounds on the Reverse HyperTM exercise machine, plus lots of heavy static holds in a belt squat machine in a weekly plan. How? Both provide traction of the spine while exercising. Get the most out of an exercise; don’t let it get the most out of you.\nTraining Methods\nWhat is strength? Strength is the athlete’s ability to generate maximum external force. In The Science and Practice of Strength Training, it talks about the only three scientific methods to develop maximal muscular tension. The most effective method to build maximum strength is the maximal effort. It is best for improving intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. It is known that the central nervous system will adapt only to the load placed on them. One cannot only use the M-E method for complete strength development. The volume and intensity must change every 72 hours. For this reason, Westside used a second method of strength development – the dynamic method. This method requires one to throw or lift a non-maximal load with the highest possible velocity. It is impossible to attain maximum force (Fmm) in fast movement against intermediate resistance. This shows the dynamic method is not used for increasing maximal strength, but only to improve the rate of force development and explosive strength. The dynamic method changed the Westside system in 1982 forever. The third method is the repeated effort method, which many will use with heavy weights for six to eight reps. This method builds muscle mass by doing the higher reps, but only strength on the final rep in a fatigued state. In the classical lifts, it can cause injury to the weakest muscle groups – meaning pulling a pec in bench pressing, or straining the lower back while pulling or squatting. Like science experiments, single joint exercises are used for safety. Westside has found a similar approach by doing many extensions for the triceps, knee, lower back, hamstrings, and the like. This has made it possible for Westside to continuously raise total volume by using large and small special exercises. The Reverse Hyper volume can be for 100 to 150,000 pounds per week. Note – there can be some confusion on the number of M-E lifts in a yearly plan.\nThe Bulgarian weightlifter would lift a max 4,000 times a year. While the Soviet Union lifter, like Westside lifters, do about 600 maxes a year. The difference was how the two teams determined a max. The Bulgarians would count on a daily max. Theirs was a training max (TFmm) while the Soviet Union, like Westside, counts only all-time maxes (CFmm).\nThe Science and Practice of Strength Training explained that strength is measured in velocity, not weight. Explosive strength is in fast velocity – about 30 to 40 percent. Speed strength is in intermediate velocity – about 70 to 85 percent. Strength speed is in slow velocity – 90 percent and above. And of course, isometric strength is measured at zero velocity. This is also where maximal strength is measured.\nExperts classified strength by the change of muscle length. So isometrics are constant. Because of no shortening of length, there is little to no inflammation. This can be a major plus in training. Also, when doing static work, the effect of work can vary 15 degrees above and below the bar position.\nBecause strength training can be aimed at certain muscle groups and certain muscle groups will vary greatly from one to another, a wide range of small special exercises must be employed. For instance, one can rotate for the hamstrings, standing leg curl, laying leg curl, calf ham-glute raises, the Westside inverse leg curl, and band and ankle leg curls for 100 to 200 reps for soft tissue strengthening.\nWe can go on and on, but let’s look at the relationship to force and velocity. Look and study Hill’s equation of muscle contractions. It is easy to see motion velocity decreases as external loads increase. This means that maximum force (Fmm) is attained when velocity is small. This means maximum velocity (Vmm) is attained when external resistance is close to zero. Here are three examples that will be easy to recognize: A javelin is very light and when released, its velocity is above 30 meters per second.\nA shot put at 16 pounds is released at about 14 meters per second by top throwers.\nWhen training the deadlift at 60 percent of a 1 rep max, the bar moves at roughly one meter per second. This clearly shows the relationship between force and velocity. This is just a small teaser of what information you can find in V. M. Zatsiorsky’s Science and Practice of Strength Training. If you truly want to be knowledgeable about strength training and the science behind it, the book is a must. Thank you V. M. Zatsiorsky for making it possible for Westside to accomplish what is has over the last 34 years.",

Stress however can and should be defined as anything that disrupts our allostasis/homeostasis. Taking this into account, we can conclude that pretty much anything we do in our daily lives can place our body under stress. Stress is non-specific, in other words your body will not differentiate between stressors, whether physical or emotional. The body does not know whether you just hit multiple 1RM attempts, performed an intense anaerobic conditioning session, stayed up all night worrying about which bills need to be paid or had an argument with your significant other. Albeit to differing degrees, it still only recognises stress. The stress response then is the body’s concerted effort to maintain allostasis in the event of this stress, or group of stressors, and is absolutely vital to life. It does this by rapidly increasing various hormones and/or mobilising energy to where it’s needed based off of these perceived stressors. Almost everyone has heard of the Central Nervous System, the brain and spinal cord, but it is the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) that does the work behind the scenes trying to keep us alive by keeping our bodies in a constant state of balance.The Autonomic Nervous System does this job through its two main branches:1) Sympathetic2) Parasympathetic.Although both branches have opposing effects, they work in harmony in a synergistic/push-pull fashion to regulate many different bodily functions such as blood sugar, heart rate, oxygen uptake, blood PH as well as a cascade of various hormones.The heart is the most important muscle in the human body. It is responsible for constantly delivering blood, oxygen and nutrients throughout the body failing which we would die. Contrary to popular belief the heart does not beat like a metronome, with precise beats. The rhythm of the heart has a natural fluctuation due to the different inputs of the previously mentioned Autonomic Nervous System. By looking at the variance between heart beats we can see the balance, or lack of, between sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. The Sympathetic System: The sympathetic system’s job is to speed up various processes within the body. It is also responsible for the fight or flight stress response and can be seen as being catabolic in nature. This response will increase heart rate and blood pressure, inhibits digestion, reduces appetite, and diverts blood to the working musculature and releases sugars / fats into the bloodstream for energy usage.The Parasympathetic System: The parasympathetic system does the opposite. It is responsible for decreasing heart rate and blood pressure, stimulating digestion, increasing appetite, dilating blood vessels and promoting energy storage. It can be seen as being anabolic in nature. Using training as the example stressor, there is a large sympathetic shift that occurs with all its ensuing process' ( i.e. heart rate goes up, blood pressure increases, energy stores are mobilised etc…) Once the stressor, in this case training, has passed there is then a parasympathetic shift which pull’s those process’ back down allowing our body to settle back into homeostasis.Generally speaking the harder the stress, the longer it takes the body to achieve this this re-balancing act. If sympathetic function is high and parasympathetic low, this is a sign that the body is under acute stress (training for example) and the body’s energy supplies and process’ are being used to meet that physical demand. This is generally seen through a reduction in HRV score and parasympathetic protocols are advised here to induce restoration.On the other hand, if sympathetic function is low and parasympathetic function is high, this is a sign that the body is in a stage of restoration and adaption. Acutely, this can also be a sign of 'detraining' for example when an athlete that undergoes high amounts of aerobic volume stops a sharp increase in parasympathetic dominance can happen as a sign that there isn't enough of a stimulus for adaption to keep occurring.Recovery: It is also important to understand which recovery strategies should be employed based off nervous system functioning. If the client is sympathetic then parasympathetic recovery strategies are needed for restoration. Far too often the same stressor is applied as a recovery modality which can end up pushing the client and athlete further away from balance into an overtrained state - the complete opposite of what recovery protocols should be doing.Example recovery strategies for sympathetic dominance would be:- Reduced Intensity (90% work, alactic/lactic pieces etc)- Light Massage- Yoga/Meditation- Sleep- Active Aerobic RecoveryExample recovery strategies for parasympathetic dominance:- Reduce Volume (or Intensity)- Deep Tissue Massage- Sauna - Cold Water ImmersionIn essence with HRV we can take a look 'under the hood' and view the athletes unique physiological stress response allowing for optimal training and recovery strategies to be implemented and potentially doing away with outdated protocols such as de-loads and optimising peaking phases for competition.We can also use HRV and RHR as simple tests for cardiovascular function and use the continuing data to truly crack the clients quest for health and longevity through fitness. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Clients are different, physiologically, psychologically and everything in between. Their goals, needs and ability to adapt to training and lifestyle stressor’s will all be different, and so their programming structure should reflect this too.Some of the biggest factor’s that will affect an athlete’s adaptability to training will be the following:1: Their NME rating (Neuro-Muscular Efficiency)2: Their mitochondrial make-up & dominant muscle fibre type3: Their own unique psychologyThere are both genetic AND epigenetic factors that contribute to these three traits, and so ALL can be trained to some extent, which thankfully as a coach is where we can help. Let us take a look at the three more in-depth and see how we can help the athlete to develop each to levels that will improve their athletic endeavours, whatever those may look like.NME/NEUROMUSCULAR-EFFICIENCY:An athlete’s neuromuscular efficiency is directly related to their genetic make-up (mitochondrial make-up & dominant muscle fiber type), their training age (the nervous systems adaptions to training whether novice/in-experienced to advanced/experienced) and their sport of choice (a type 2b dominant athlete who finds an explosive sport to compete in for example will be genetically suited for this sport and so training age won’t be AS prevalent an issue in this case, compared to someone new to the modality without the optimal genetic traits).Because of the inherent hormonal and fibre type differences in females relative to males, they will generally have lower NME and will need higher volumes at 'higher' percentages to elicit an adequate stress response for strength adaptions to ensue. Athletes with a young training age will be less efficient, in general, because of lack of nervous system adaption’s due simply to inexperience and so do well at higher volumes and more time ‘under the bar.’ Those with a higher aerobic capacity also tend to need the same, as strength development is slower for these guys because of additional mitochondrial/fibre type adaptions’ due to environment (sport of choice having been aerobic-dominant for example).Hormonal output is also a factor here and the use of drugs can be a game changer and is another huge reason for their widespread use throughout sport. Aerobic athletes and females can effectively ‘cheat’ physiology by using, as an example, testosterone derivatives to elicit muscle size, strength and power adaptions’ which would usually take a much longer time for those athletes to incur naturally. Conversely strength athletes can do the same by using substances like EPO (Erythropoietin) for it’s increased mitochondrial function and oxygen uptake for the working musculature, in essence allowing those athlete’s who would usually fatigue a lot faster to do a higher volume of work aerobically.How to test for NME: Neuromuscular efficiency is probably the easiest of the three to test for. A simple Back Squat Test will suffice here and consists of the athlete finding their current 1RM and then performing as many reps as possible at 85% with a fixed Tempo. If the athlete scores low repetitions here (2-4) they are deemed to have high efficiency and can tap into their motor units sufficiently to perform nervous system demanding feats on the absolute strength end of the force velocity curve. Those who score higher repetitions (8-10+) are deemed less efficient and, depending on their goals, might need more neurally-demanding training protocols in their program.*How to Train it: If you have an athlete that need’s more neural training to improve efficiency (1RM sports for example) there are a few different protocols that can be used, based on the athletic goals given. A novice athlete simply needs to spend more time stressing the nervous system and it is for this reason that more volume at what would generally be considered higher percentages for trained individuals is required. Females too need to perform the same type of work, although for different reasons (mainly hormonal). Athlete’s deemed very aerobic or type 1 dominant can also become more efficient here by performing a-lactic power type conditioning work in order to produce higher power outputs in this realm (once absolute strength has been increased adequately), while those athlete’s deemed more absolutely strong than fast on the force-velocity curve can use speed-strength type exercises to improve motor unit recruitment and increase rate of force development. Those athletes on the other hand deemed faster and more explosive naturally rather than strong can benefit similarly by performing more maximal effort work within the program. It is these athletes who are naturally more prone to injury because of the high forces generated in plyometrics, bounding and landing type movements. If a sufficient base of absolute strength isn't underlying these other strength qualities, connective tissues cannot cope with the stress.*For those athlete’s who are deemed already very efficient neuromuscularly a need to ‘de-train’ the nervous system response is warranted if competitive CrossFit is the goal. By ‘de-train’ what we really mean is getting the athlete used to hitting more repetitions at a higher percentage of 1RM than they’re used to without fatiguing quickly, which is crucial for the sport. This can be accomplished a couple of way’s successfully. Improving overall GPP/Aerobic capacity (which will help with the onset of blood lactate accumulation and it's usage as an actual fuel source) while utilising what is commonly known as Creatine Phosphate battery work (which is working with weights at around 85-90% of 1RM for multiple repetitions regularly), will enable the athlete to do work much more comfortably here when called upon. Which in the unique sport which is CrossFit, is fairly often.**MITOCHONDRIAL MAKE-UP & DOMINANT MUSCLE FIBRE TYPE:Another determining factor is the athlete’s mitochondrial make-up and dominant muscle fibre type (type 1, type 2a or 2b). Although another factor that is directly related to genetics, these are also related to an extent to the athlete’s environment i.e sport of choice, lifestyle etc. Although you cannot make type 1 fibres into type 2b there is evidence that the middle ground fibres can take on characteristics on either end with environmental stress, or in other words, training. As a coach, it is important to realize that many times those athletes who present with more characteristics on one end of the scale might not like putting in volumes of work on the other. Type 2b dominant athletes for example (strength/power athletes) do not like high volumes of slow endurance work traditionally, and vice versa with endurance athletes undertaking high NME or Type 2b dominant stimuli. Again however, this is something that can be trained, and very successfully in our experience.If an athlete that is type 2b (strength/power) dominant takes up an aerobic-based sport for the first ten years of their life they will make certain physiological adaptions both on a mitochondrial level and by helping to shift some of those middle ground fibre types to the side being trained, in this case the type 1 'side'. So, although the athlete’s physiological profile might suit the strength sports better, their training environment has allowed for adaptions which make them a more well rounded athlete in general. If you are involved in the 1RM sports (powerlifting/weightlifitng), although GPP is always advised, what matters most for the sport is becoming as neuromuscularly efficient as possible and so the vast majority of your training should be centred around the creatine phosphate side of the curve, with an emphasis on maximal effort and dynamic effort work to increase strength/motor unit recruitment and increase rate of force development, and the repetition method for volume to increase hypertrophy and the cross-sectional area of muscle which will enable you to also increase force. How to test for it: Apart from in-lab testing of vo2max and lactate threshold (which are also test/movement specific), which isn’t going to be viable for a lot of coaches, you just need to know your athlete. If your athlete is an aerobic monster who utilizes oxygen efficiently and paces everything really well, you might want to make them more well rounded by training them to learn to produce strength and power on the CP side of the energy system curve, which depending on their athletic endeavor of choice, might look like the NME examples provided above. If on the other hand your athlete is absolutely strong on the CP side but cannot breath and utilize oxygen efficiently and gasse’s quickly, a lot more low-level aerobic work should play a part in their program if the goal is a well rounded fitness capacity. On this point, a big mistake with this type of athlete can be to train aerobic power pieces exclusively as a means of building ‘aerobic capacity.’ However aerobic power and overall base capacity are not the same thing and throwing aerobic power volumes at athlete’s without a large underlying aerobic base can lead to stalling in power output’s at higher heart rates and is akin to giving a beginning strength training athlete maximal effort work in an attempt to become stronger. A pyramid is only as tall as it’s base, and in training terms your aerobic power output at higher heart rates will only be it’s most effective with a large underlying capacity to supply fuel for the demand.THE ATHLETE’S PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE: The athlete’s psychology also plays a large role in their training experience and dose response. The athlete for example who is predominantly a type 2b athlete (strength/power) and does well here will generally not (but not always) like spending significant quantity’s of time doing stuff they suck at as previously discussed. ESPECIALLY if a lack of confidence or insecurity are present in the athlete’s psychological profile, in any area of life. If they need to feel good and secure they will do what they know they are already good at, as opposed to spending time and volume doing stuff that doesn’t make them look or feel as good. Also, those deemed introvert in nature tend to do well with volumes of work they are good at and/or are familiar and comfortable with. Extroverts can do well on programs offering different stimuli as regularly as possible to keep them excited and interested in the program. This area in particular is where you must know your athlete. Constantly providing training stimuli to your athlete’s that are not their strong points can be psychologically draining and lead to a decrease in mental acuity, training productiveness and belief in the program, in effect hampering the training program as a whole. This is thankfully however another area that can absolutely be trained and as a coach it is our responsibility to point those athlete’s in need in the direction of as much mental training resources as possible, whether from reading material, workshops or through the hiring of actual sports psychologists, and help the athlete to realise their potential.The take home message when programming for your athlete’s is to understand that everybody is different and a one-size-fits-all fitness prescription is shortchanging them. Yes it is an easy option for coaches to take, but we aren't in the game for easy, we are in it to produce the best results possible for everyone that walks through our doors.*As a side note to this there is a misunderstanding in the wider fitness industry between the benefits of maximal and absolute strength development on other underlying strength qualities. Understand that, if talking about the strength qualities associated with maximum force and velocity, i.e accelerative strength, strength speed, speed-strength, starting strength) then raising absolute strength absolutely will increase these strength parameters. If, on the other hand, you are talking about improvements in strength endurance this comes down to energy system substrate usage. Those strength qualities on the F/V curve are primarily influenced by ATP-CP, so of course it is a different thing completely to try develop endurance at sub-maximal percentages that utilise glycolysis and lactate etc as fuel sources.**For some athlete’s however TOO much emphasis on neurally demanding protocols can be harmful. For example, employing methods that utilise the maximal amount of force and power development (or more specifically the adaptions that they create) too much in a program can have a detrimental effect on their ability to learn how to breath, pace and stay in a non-fatigued state primarily using aerobic metabolism. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

It is much easier for a coach to put together a couplet or triplet of exercises with a short six or eight minute time cap in the name of 'intensity' than to program longer workouts that suit everybody throughout the training cycle.2) Secondly, and most obviously, is a serious lack of knowledge with regards human physiology and training adaptations. You will generally get two clients in your facility: those after health and longevity goals, who will make up the majority, and those seeking performance benefits for their respective sports', who for the most part, will be in a minority.Either way for both of these populations you cannot simply program shorter, higher intense anaerobic conditioning pieces and expect them to achieve their goals.Athlete's seeking performance benefits will suffer in two ways: they can, depending on how much volume is being put into their respective competitive sports, can easily be lead into an overtrained state due to too much unnecessary accumulative fatigue. Some day's exactly what they will need is much lower intensive aerobic work, as either a means of restorative CNS activity, or to increase underlying GPP to be able to handle the higher heart rate competitive workloads.General clients, leading on from that second point, who are after health and longevity benefits should be doing larger volumes of this type of work and concentrating on higher heart rate work can be missing the point of training completely.What we are essentially talking about with regards 'health and longevity' from a conditioning perspective is an increase in cardiac function due to positive adaptations in both muscle and peripheral tissues. And these adaptations DO NOT come from higher intense work. You MUST be working at lower intensities here, roughly 70% of your max heart rate, to induce these kind of positive health outcomes. This lower level work directly leads to eccentric cardiac hypertrophy with the supporting vascular network also increasing to support this demand, unlike what happens with anaerobic work.So think about this: how many workouts at your gym are 30-60mins in length with an emphasis on keeping your heart rate between that sweet spot of 130-150bpm?!Next time you're doing a twenty or thirty minute 'aerobic session' maybe stick on a heart rate monitor and see, you'll be suprised how quickly your heart rate exceeds these zones.You should not be solely, or even mostly, training at or above threshold for your weekly conditioning work.And if you are, ask your coach why, and when they fail to give you an answer that doesn't sound a lot like the two reasons stated above, find a coach and gym that knows better. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Not only appropriate, but the only way to go! Here is why. GPP\nLearning Technique\nPosterior Chain\nEquipment At FASST our gym is made up of adolescent, high school and college age athletes from every competitive sport, figure skating to football. We have been using Westside methods since February of 2013 following 15 years of utilizing Western periodization. As a result of switching from Western periodization to Westside Methods, our athletes report experiencing an even greater success both in the weight room and on field/court or ice. For example, a ninth grade football player who benches 295, Box squats 425 and Dead lifts 400 and is poised to have a stellar Sophomore season as the starting varsity running back. We also have a ninth grader who dead lifts 330 for a three rep max effort and a 17 year old quarterback who dead lifts 308 for a 3 rep max. We also have a 165LB college second baseman that dead lifted 425 for a one rep max. What does all of this mean? Think transfer for a moment. All of these athletes came in with similar goals, mostly to increase speed. There are numerous studies that prove increasing muscular strength increases speed of movement, F=MxA is Newton’s Second Law. Each of these athletes concentrated on one thing in the weight room, getting stronger. Consequently, there speed increased. The type of programming that was put together for them was a Westside spilt of a large base of General Physical Preparedness (GPP), max effort, dynamic effort, repetition method, and jumping for explosive power. Let’s examine one of their programs more closely:\nJared, freshman, varsity football: Started weight training at age 12 in the seventh grade. He was already playing football so we began building his foundation with lots of GPP. These exercises included sled dragging, jumping, kettle bells, battling ropes and lots of learning technique on box squatting, sumo pulling and bench pressing with light weights.\nIn year two as an eighth grader, Jared made his Junior Varsity team and excelled at running back. Many of his pears were not yet lifting weights because of the “myth” of stunting growth. He was stronger and faster than all of the other eight graders. At age 13 he was taking max efforts of a 3RM, and beginning to learn more exercises like using bands on certain exercises like his hamstrings by doing prone leg curls with a band around his ankles, band pull-apart for rear delts and box squatting with a red mini band. Technique was always of utmost importance. Workouts lasted no more than one hour and the frequency during the off season was 4 times per week.\nIn year three, preparing for his first varsity season at age 14, and with three full years of training under his belt he ran a 4.87 40yard dash at a body weight of 200LBS.\nFASST has been introducing Westside Methodologies to several area high schools that we work with such New Rochelle, Mount Vernon, Nyack, and Clarkstown South High Schools. All of these schools coaches and players report not only increased strength, but strength in the right muscle group’s i.e. posterior chain. Perhaps most important is that all of the young athletes report enjoying the workouts more due to the Conjugate System of constantly switching exercises. Not knowing what they are going to train day to day has kept them from getting stale in the weight room. Westside for Youth is GPP. Young athletes must develop a wide base of physical fitness through many exercises. This provides the opportunity for the young athlete to develop strength, fitness, balance, coordination and to understand the “vocabulary” of his/her Coach.\nWestside is technique, technique, technique. Youth must learn proper squat, bench and dead lifting form in order to succeed and stay safe long term.\nPosterior Chain. Every athlete wants to get faster but what they do not know is that \"Speed of Movement is dependent upon Absolute Strength.\" F=MxA Westside emphasizes Newton’s Second law! Get stronger in the right muscle groups for sports!\nAn athlete must train on certain pieces of equipment in order to develop the posterior chain. There is no equipment in the world more suited for this than the Reverse Hyper, Belt Squat, and Inverse Curl. Likewise, an athlete must do certain exercises such as drag a sled of various weights and distances, sumo dead lift, box squat and perform jumps for explosive power in order to increase speed. These are all components of Westside Methods. The bottom line is, a resounding Yes! Westside is appropriate for youth athletes and there is no better system in the world! <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Mobility is defined as: the ability to move or be moved freely and easily. We know we should have optimal mobility, but do we really understand why we have to have mobility to have optimal function? A major factor is because humans don’t exist in isolation; we interact with the world around us.\nFor us to truly understand why mobility is so important we need to have a grasp on the science of the physical environment in which our bodies exist and function in. Understanding our physical environment will only empower us, enabling us to recognize the importance of how optimal mobility enables us to have the ability to optimally function. We interact with multiple forces in the physical environment that our bodies function in.\nUnderstanding Newton’s Third Law is crucial. To simplify, I break the Law into 3 parts. Part one of the Law states: forces always come in pairs: equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs. For instance, we know that with everything we do our bodies have to deal with the force of gravity. Gravity is the force that attracts our bodies towards the center of the earth. Often, we forget about its opposite action-reaction force; ground reaction force (GRF).\nTo understand human biomechanics it is essential we first understand the interaction of forces in the physical environment that human biomechanics occurs in. Everyone knows gravity, and if you are clumsy like me, have probably experienced it firsthand by falling a time or two. We blame gravity for the fall, but gravity is not acting alone. We experience gravity during the fall but when we make contact with the ground our body experiences the interaction of gravity with GRF.\nIt’s this interaction in time with gravity and GRF that we physically feel the pain from falling. If we drop a glass, gravity alone does not break it. Gravity’s interaction with GRF with the glass cup and the ground is what shatters it. Other factors obviously go into the equation like mass, velocity, direction, etc., but the main focus here is to understand action-reaction forces. Lucky for us when we fall, we are not as fragile as the glass. A simple, somewhat comparable object to humans would be a basketball.\nWhen the basketball makes contact with the ground we know that gravity and GRF interact with ball and the ground. In physics this is defined as the moment when a pair of forces (gravity and GRF) are acting on two interacting objects (the basketball and the ground). This is where we need to understand part two of Newton’s Third Law which states that: the size of the forces on the first object (ball) equals the size of the force on the second object (ground).\nWe have seen this Law simply stated as: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When the glass interacted with gravity and GFR at the ground and shattered, it was due to the fact that the glass did not have the ability to transform the energy of the interaction, so therefore it simply breaks.\nWhen the ball interacted with gravity and GRF at the ground it bounces back in the opposite direction (that is if it is properly inflated) due to its ability to transform the energy from the interaction of the forces at the ground. We can experience this equal opposite reaction force when we start to bounce a ball with more force into the ground; it comes back with the same increased force.\nThe reaction of the ball bouncing back into our hand enables us to understand the third part of Newton’s Third Law which states: the direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object. The ball left our hand into the direction of the ground.\nFollowing its interactions with action-reaction forces at the ground, the ball’s ability to transform the energy from that interaction enables it to bounce back and travel in the exact opposite direction of the ground, returning back into our hand. To better understand the physical environment, we need to understand one more Law of physics which is: The Law of Conservation of Energy.\nThe Law states that: energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one form into another to transferred from one object to another. For example, when the glass made contact with the ground, the energy from the interaction of forces shattered it and no energy was lost. When the ball made contact with the ground, the energy from the interaction of forces was transferred from the ground into the ball, enabling it to bounce back into our hand.\nIn the physical environment in which we exist, these two Laws work in conjunction to enable efficient human function. Lenny Parracino, Fellow of Applied Functional Science at the Gray Institute, articulated it by stating that: “We need energy to move. Energy allows work to occur. Work is the function of forces. Forces change the way we move. If we want to stop and change direction, we need to exert a force. But we cannot exert a force unless we have energy.”\nJust like the example of the basketball, in gait when our foot comes in contact with the ground, we are able to transform the energy of that action-reaction interaction of forces to propel us into walking. However, if we lack optimal mobility in the foot/ankle complex, the transformation of energy will be inefficient. Lenny Parracino calls the inefficient transfer of energy through our bodies “energy leaks”.\nOptimal human function in the physical environment can then be defined as efficient energy transformations during biomechanics where no energy is “leaked”. Optimal human function in regards to the interaction with the physical environment is for the body to possess the ability for the energy of action-reaction interaction forces to enter into the system and efficiently travel through the body.\nIf we have optimal mobility in each joint, as the energy travels through those joints, motion in 3 dimensional space will occur. Joints are not isolated but integrated. An action or lack of action in one joint creates a reaction or lack of a reaction in the other joint(s) which articulate to it in the kinetic chain. In other words, each joint plays a role to each other and to the body as a whole.\nIf we lack mobility in a joint, there will be stillness. As motion and energy enter into the immobile joint, injury and trauma to the joint and surrounding tissue is likely to occur. If the force entering the immobile joint exceeds the individual’s adaptive potential, injury is very likely. This lack of the energy to be able to efficiently travel through the body is an example of an “energy leak.”\nWhen the joints in our body lack the ability to transform energy efficiently, our joints function more like the glass than the ball in the previous examples. In the athletic setting, these inefficiencies greatly reduce one’s athletic potential. By understanding the physical environment that human biomechanics occur in, we can understand why we need to possess optimal mobility to have optimal function.\nThe objective in human function is to strive for efficiency instead of just being effective. Therefore, we need to identify any inefficiencies and address them to not only prevent injury but to optimize performance. Just like gravity works as a pair with GRF, mobility works in unison with stability. That is why I stated optimal mobility is needed for efficient human function.\nJust as too little mobility is not good for the system, too much mobility is also harmful. What is needed is the optimal amount of both mobility and stability. The structures need to be mobile enough to move while at the same time being stable enough to return. We do not want to create mobility in a structure unless at the same time we are creating stability. It would be illogical to create motion and flexibility if we cannot control it. Mobility without stability is the definition of injury.\nYou would be able to move in one direction but due to the lack of control, would not have the ability to stabilize and transform to move in a different direction. During a conversation over two years ago, Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell gave me a Basic Physics book that would forever change my perspective and understanding on both treatment and training. I am forever grateful.\nI want to credit the Gray Institute for furthering my eduction and understanding of human function.",

His knowledge of sports has certainly surpassed his athletic supremacy. His experience is not only limited to the hammer but also the shot put and discus which is evident by his work on the throws program from 1976 to 1992 which made it possible to produce many world and olympic champions. He became a doctor of pedagogical science at the University of Kiev. Dr. Anatoliy Bondarchuk brought his great knowledge to the public with nearly 200 articles on throwing as well as 11 books. Of particular interest to me are three that come to mind. These books prove he has given back to the sport he came from. There are thousands of coaches but just a few teachers and Dr. Bondarchuk is most certainly one of those few. In his book Champion School he outlines a multi year program for many sports. In the U.S.A everyone wants a short training cycle (8,12,16 weeks etc) but one must use a multi year system. After all High School and College require there athletes to excel over a 4 year period. And of course the Olympics are contested every four years. Dr. Bondarchuk trained using a multi year cycle under the great Soviet sports coaches and sports scientists and he now passes all this knowledge on to Coaches and Athletes alike. It covers all aspects of training from; - Training Age - The development of Speed of special types - Strength development - Special Exercises for throwing - Strategy of training and much much more This is a MUST for your library. Dr. Bondarchuk also offers two books that everyone involved in perfecting sports should own, namely; - Transfer Of Training In Sports - Transfer Of Training In Sports Volume 2 It does no good to be strong in the wrong exercise, nor does it do any good to do certain exercises at the wrong time. Dr. Bondarchuk discusses this and much more. As well as the concept of delayed transformation and all aspects of the development of speed and speed endurance. All aspects of strength and special strengths are shown to build the foundation for advanced training. Dr. Bondarchuk completely explains the importance of training cycles through out a sports career. Great Reading for all Coaches and Athletes to have in there ever growing Libraries.",

His answer may surprise many, but this is how it was told to me. After sitting down with one of his favorite books Hagakure – being a great fan of Miyamoto Musashi and his writings – he talked about one of Musashi’s duals early in his quest to become a samurai.\nHe came upon a master of the chain and cycle who recognized him and challenged him to a dual. As they engaged in combat to the death, the old and very clever chain and cycle master managed to rip the long sword from Musashi’s grip. This was disastrous, and left Musashi with only his short sword – which was never to be thrown at any time. But Musashi did throw it and killed the older master. Musashi retrieved his long sword and started walking toward town. When he came upon his master of the sword, he ran to his master and said, “Did you see how I defeated the chain and cycle master?” His master looked at him and in a solemn voice said, “You are not a samurai. You are just a tough guy with little integrity on how you kill a human.” At this moment, the sword master turned and walked away.\nThis devastated the young Musashi, but made him contemplate his journey to become a master samurai. As he walked toward town, he attended his long sword. He found a nick in the blade and so found the nearest sword polisher to repair the sword of death. As he walked in the first sword shop he found, he asked a young apprentice to repair and polish his sword.\nUpon examining the sword, the young apprentice said that the nick looked like it came from a chain. Musashi told the apprentice of his dual and how he killed the old chain and cycle master. The apprentice handed the sword back to Musashi and told him to leave immediately with his tool of death. It disgusted the apprentice.\nMusashi was furious and retrieved his long sword and walked out. He started down the street thinking … how could this lowly apprentice not repair this magnificent piece of death? But then he thought about what his old sword master said about not being a real samurai. He turned around and walked back into the sword shop and walked up to a frightened apprentice, bowed down with his sword laying across his out stretched hands, and said, “Will you please polish my soul?” At this, the apprentice also bowed down and said, “I am not worthy to do so, but I will have my master repair your soul, as only a true master can repair such a divine sword.”\nThis story is how Louie sees Westside … as his living soul. Always trying to sharpen his soul and polish the athletes that reside at Westside. He, too, found anyone can be a tough guy, but very few can become a samurai in their craft.\nHe found that a coach is much like a bow, and the men and women under him are the arrows. If the bow is aimed in the wrong direction, the arrows will not hit the target. This is how Louie views Westside.\nAs Musashi cut down 60 men in death duals, Westside has seen nearly as many gyms die to ignorance and jealousy. Westside has a common goal to aim for excellence and beyond. A gym is only as strong as its lowliest lifter. When someone thinks they’re the best, they seldom are. In the end, everyone will get stuck, and you then find if you are a samurai, or just another tough guy.",

The answer simply is the Westside Barbell Belt Squat™ Machine. Hands down this is the most effective device to strengthen and condition a fighter at the same time. It puts no load on the upper back or shoulders as the weight belt is pulling from the hips down which will actually traction out the spine and can help cure pelvic tilt.\nTime under tension is the key component of what gets a person strong. Due to the belt squats design I can have a 170lbs fighter like Matt Brown perform belt squat walks or belt squat grappling for 5 minutes straight with a weight of 355lbs constantly pulling him down from the hips. When a fighter can do this without fatigue in training come fight day there opponent is in a world of trouble. Depending on the exercise or movement selected this belt squat does and will build tremendous strength in the glutes, hamstrings, hips, lower back and upper back while increasing the fighters lactate threshold, rate of force development and dynamic strength endurance. In preparation for all fights Eddie Wineland under the guidance of his Special Strengths coach Jason Gus will use the Belt squat as an essential corner stone of there strength and conditioning protocol. Below is an example of some of the many exercises that are performed with all our fighters below. BELT SQUAT WALKING HOW TO EXECUTE THE MOVEMENT\nStand in a wider than shoulder width stance with the belt placed around the hips and lower back. Start to walk forward then backward pushing from the sides of your feet keeping the stance wide. This is a great exercise to both warm up with or to use as an end of workout conditioning exercise.*Throw in some upper body shadow boxing or overhead kettlebell presses to add variety to the exercise.Sets (1-3) Reps (5 minutes per set)Weight on the Belt Squat-Start with 90lbs at the beginning. The aim is to have at least your body weight on the machine while performing each exercise! HOW TO EXECUTE THE MOVEMENT\nStand in a wider than shoulder width stance with the belt placed around the hips and lower back. Then Choke 2 Westside Barbell mini bands onto the belt squat frame making sure to place them wider than the body. While holding the bands in each hand in a upper body fighting stance start to walk forward and backward pushing from the sides of your feet always keeping the stance wide while simultaneously throwing punches and elbows and ALWAYS keeping the hands up at head height.\nSets (1-3) Reps (5 minutes per set)\nWeight on the Belt Squat-Start with 90lbs at the beginning. The aim is to have at least your body weight on the machine while performing each exercise! BANDED SHADOW BOXING QUASI-ISOMETRIC SQUATTING HOW TO EXECUTE THE MOVEMENT\nStand on two disc stability pillows in a wider than shoulder width stance with the belt squat attachment connected to heavy bag. Grasp the bag in a gable grip and walk from side to side on the same spot. This exercise is a great fight conditioning tester for us and we usually perform this at the end of work out when an athlete is in a somewhat fatigues state.\n*To change this up remove the discs pillows and walk forward and back with the bag.\n(Sets) 1 set of 5 minutes\nWeight on the Belt Squat-Start with just the bag at the beginning. The aim is to have at least your ¼ of your body weight on the machine while performing this exercise!\nThe Exercises and drills that can be done on this are limitless. We try to change the exercise stimulus on the belt every 3 weeks and always making it progressively difficult within that time frame. Upper body pad work and belt squat grappling adds a new dimension to fight specific training, If you don’t have a Westside belt squat, find one! Even better make your gym or strength coach get one or at least try it out. I assure you that it is a game changer in over all strength and conditioning for all athletes especially for those in combat sports.\nRemember that strength is the great equalizer,\nStay Strong,\nTom\nwww.westside-barbell.com HOW TO EXECUTE THE MOVEMENT\nStand on two disc stability pillows in a wide fighters stance or a shoot position with the belt placed around the hips and lower back. Begin to lower yourself very slowly into a squat like position pushing your knees out and pushing from the sides of your feet and then slowly raise your self back up. It should take you 30 seconds to squat down and 30 seconds to come back up.\n(Sets) 1 set of 5 minutes\nWeight on the Belt Squat-Start with 90lbs at the beginning. The aim is to have at least your body weight on the machine while performing each exercise! GABLE GRIP BAG WALKS",

She drove 75 miles, three times a week from June of ’88 until the time she moved to be near Westside in December of ’88. Amy came with a 716 pound total and her former trainer said that that was all she had. That was not only an insult to her, but also to me. Amy went on to total 1,440 lbs. She became a physical therapist full time in 1990. She won her first world title in the 123 pound bodyweight, in November of 1992 in Vegas. In November of 1992 she also set her first world record total at 123 lbs. of 1,180 lbs.\nAmy would take a call from Matt Dimel every day while he was on county vacation, yes I mean prison, to keep his spirits up. Matt was like a son to me. A bad son, but a son. Matt got out in 1992, and in 1993 won the APE senior nationals. Dave Tate moved to Westside to train and later started Elite Fitness, but that is a different story. 1992 was a crazy year. Amy gets her first world record, Dave Tate moves to Westside, Matt gets out of the big house, and Chuck Vogelpohl gets his neck broken by Matt while wrestling in the gym. I say gym, but it is the club, where we spend lots of time together outside of the gym.\nAmy is at it again and breaks the world record with a bench press of 292 lbs. at 123 lbs. In ’02 she was the only woman to qualify for the WPO. In ’03 she totaled 1,300, 505 – 330 – 465, at 132 lbs. Then, in ’07, she totaled 10x her bodyweight at the Arnold Classic, on March 2nd, 2007. Her bodyweight was at 59.4 kg and she did 240 kg, 152 kg, and 212 kg, for a 605 kg total. In January ’07, she made 1,330 at 131 bodyweight. Again in ’07, she made 1,440 at 147.4 with a 590 WR squat, 350 lb. bench press, and 500 lb. deadlift. Now she held the world record in two different weight classes, in one year. Her 123 total was eventually broken. She had great training partners. Gritter Adams, Todd Brock, Gabe Reitter, all training together. Also, Eskil Thomasson moved from Sweden to train at Westside for 10 years before injuries sent him home.\nSpecial note: On a trip back home to Sweden, Eskil went to Finland to find out why the Finn’s were such great pullers and found that many were lumberjacks. They said they would pull the logs down the trail by hand, in all types of manners, over the shoulder, between the legs, walking both forwards and backwards. When Eskil came back to his real home at Westside, after the telling the story, we began pulling weight sleds. Now everybody does it. So when you see a football player on TV doing it, you know where it came from. Also while back home, Eskil went to Poland and visited a weight lifting gym. There was a lifting manual that had weight lifters doing box squats. The manual was printed in 1950. I always felt that when track & field athletes came to the Culver City Westside from overseas, they showed box squatting and board pressing from the throwers, who knew George Frenn. George was the world record holder in the 56 lb. throw as well as the power lifts.\nNow, back to Amy. She has had some serious injuries that have slowed her down, but she still trains every single day while sporting a Westside tattoo, like all true Westsiders. Long live Westside, and long live Amy Weisberger.",

      "pageContent": "WHO MADE WESTSIDE IN THE 90‘s? Louie Simmons Thu Oct 13, 2016 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/CamberGM2350_ec8a6af3-548e-4cdb-8631-69d36345ccf3_720x.jpg?v=1563691230\" width=\"350\" height=\"262\" alt=\"WHO MADE WESTSIDE IN THE 90‘s?\"> Related Topics: Conjugate Method, Geared Lifting, Louie Simmons, Weight Lifting History A lot happened from 1991-2000 at Westside.\nI almost died in 1991. I ruptured my patella tendon during a low box squat. I am very sensitive to anesthesia, and the doctor knew this, but somehow after giving me a shot to calm me down for surgery, I fell asleep and they gave me anesthesia. I stopped breathing for four minutes and had to be trached as well as given chest tubes. This was a setback, to say the least. I woke up three days later and spent another four days afterwards in the hospital. I was 43 in ’91 and said I was done powerlifting after this miss hap. Little did I know, I would return again for yet another 20 years, But, let’s talk about the men who made Westside what it is today. We were at a local bench meet when I saw a jacked up guy lift without gear. At the time, in 1991, a shirt was only good for 25 to 50 lbs. George Halbert was his name. He benched 470 lbs. raw, as they say today, and was second to Jimmy Ritchie with 475 lbs. in a shirt. Jimmy told George that he could do more in a shirt, but George said he made only 473 lbs. in a shirt.\nTom Waddle knew George and said he would like him to come bench with us on Sunday, at Tim Vanhorn’s place. Only our top benchers were allowed to go to Tim’s to bench, the rest had to stay at Westside and suffer. There were just three benches and about 15 of us, so you really had to earn your spot. One day I challenged Chuck V., who had the number one bench, to bench and he said, “Mother F’er, catch us when we are out of shape”, I said “You mother F’ers are always out of shape!” When it was done, they beat us by 10 lbs. and got to keep the bench. I guess this is what George said is why he did not come to Westside for 2 years. He said, “I heard those Westside guys are crazy”, but he eventually became a Westsider and still is today. To Tom Waddle, you talked George into coming. His main training partners were Kenny Patterson and Gerry O. In ’93, I wrote an article in Powerlifting USA, entitled Three of a Kind. We were the only gym with three 600 lb. benchers, wow it has come a long way.\nArnold Coleman was just starting and later became the world record holder in the squat and total at 181. Chuck Vogelpohl would eventually not only break world records, but do so in three different weight classes. At 220 lbs. he was the lightest man ever to squat 1,000 lbs. But all still holds the world record at 42 of 1,140 lbs. His 1,180 lbs. squat at 264 lbs. bodyweight. He was the greatest squatter of all time. Until his teammate Dave Hoff would do 1,210 at 271 lb. bodyweight. These numbers seem crazy after Matt Dimel’s 1,010 lb. world record at SHW in the 80’s.\nJ. M. Blakely also benched with us. He was a very strong bencher. I remember JM doing 585 lbs. for easy sets of three reps. George was a real student of the game, he was very fast. Kenny had a great lockout. Then there was Jim, who was very slow but not explosive. It was very profound when George said he learned a lot from JM and Kenny, but that they never learned anything from him. Gerry O was to win a national championship. Like today, only top ranked lifters trained at Westside back in the 90’s.\nDave Tate came to Westside but was not sure about our system. But after six months of no progress, he jumped on board and began to make great progress. Dave was very explosive and also very crazy. His name was Zippy in the gym, when the crazy came out to play. He was a great training partner with his Zippy fired personality, along with Chuck V. who could never do enough in the workouts, and the two carried me along with them. I know they tried to kill me, but I am still in good enough shape to be their pallbearer, you assholes.\nChuck was one of the strongest men I ever trained with. I saw him do 1,100 lb. rack pulls from just above the knee and a good box squat with 885 lbs. of bar weight plus 640 lbs. of band tension. Chuck and I would workout for 30-45 minutes before anyone else showed up. He would do 1,000 crunches a day and too many lat pull downs to count. I asked him, “What do you get out of lat pull downs?” He said, “Nothing, I just like to do them.” I also asked him, “What do you get out of those heavy pulls?” He said they taught him how to strain. I thought, “He knows how to strain”, but I guess that is how he discovered to do so. Then it made sense. He was not only a lightweight 220 lb. champ at the WPO but also the heavyweight champ at 275 lbs. This was not an easy task as the world’s best lifter at the Arnold Classic.\nWestside was never and will never be a gym, but rather a club. This is important, as everyone has a role helping with loading and with the lifter. An army is only as strong as its weakest soldier. That is the saying I would attach.\nJoe McCoy was a young, great lifter at the time, winning a WPC world at 19 years old. He trained with George Halbert and Kenny Patterson, along with the others. Kenny Patterson was the youngest to hold an open world record at 19 years old with a 716 lb. bench press. In Texas, John Inzer put on a Bash for Cash along with Joe McCoy. George was lifting in their first big money meet. As was Anthony Clark, a big star, looking to his 800 lb. bench which would be a milestone at the time. I think he made a 770 lb. bench in his reverse grip style. At the end, there was $10,000 in cash and prizes for the winner. It was given to Clark. But, being very good at math, I found that Kenny had actually won instead. But everyone had left the building. I told John Inzer. He made it good by sending K.P. money and all kinds of stuff, including a Dune Buggy. Even today, John Inzer is a great friend to Westside and its lifters, helping out in any way possible.\nGeorge made his benches mostly from his strong chest. Because of this, he had many tares. I told him he must make his triceps stronger so that they can carry most of the load. One day, after speed bench, George tried a 495 lb. close grip bench, but missed it at the top. He was not happy to say the least. On the next ME day, he chose to do close grip. I knew he would. He made 495 close, but afterwards missed 515 close. Then, he loaded 550 lbs. on the bar. KP and I told him not to do it, just to F with him. He takes a wide grip, and blows up a raw 550 lb. bench. At that point, KP and I dropped to our knees and said “We are not worthy” over and over again as we raised our hands over our heads 10 times. Long live King George.\nTom Waddle was a great team member, but was very unpredictable to say the least. After many tries, Tom finally won his first Senior Nationals. After pulling the winning deadlift, I ran on stage to congratulate him and he yells, “Westside rules,” just as I get to him he also yells out, “and you all suck” to about 700 people in the audience. I about passed out. But that was Tom, Westside to the bone, forever.\nGeorge could blow up anything of his chest, but could not lockout big weights. Kenny P. was just the opposite. But, George finally got it right. And the two were almost even for years. George started out at 275 lbs. bodyweight but took his weight down to 198 for his first world record. In Daytona, George made three world record benches to beat the then current world record holder, Dave Waterman. In the warmup room, Dave said to me, “I have never had even competition before,” and I replied, “You do now.”\nRob “Fuzz dog” Fusner broke the 308 world bench record giving Westside three bench world record holders at the same time. I don’t think this has ever happened, before or after. Kenny P. and George were the best coefficient benchers in the world for almost ten years. Rob was also very strong in all the powerlifts. In York, PA, at the IPA World Cup, Rob was lifting against Dave Barno, a strong competitor and friend. But on that day, Rob beat Dave. It was not easy to beat Dave, but Rob came through for Westside. These guys could bench about 600 lbs. and at the time, you only got up to 100 lbs. out of the best shirts.\nKenny P. was not doing well, and I said, “Kenny, I am going to come out of retirement after tearing my patellar tendon in half, plus almost dying in ’91.” This was now 1995. KP said to me, “Old man, you will never have 700 lbs. on your back again.” Well, he brought me out of retirement and I made in the 7’s, 8’s and even 920 lbs. putting me third in the Open World plus fourth in the total, at 50 years old. I can thank Kenny for my success. But, Kenny never did break his 728 world record again. He made it possible for me to make a 1,885 lb. total at 63 years old, 20 years after I had retired, making top 10 for 30 years and a USPF Elite Total for 37 years. Thanks KP.\nTom, Kenny, Rob, and Mickey Tate are long gone, but George is still training a group of benchers at Westside. I remember Mickey Tate was at Vanhorn’s gym one Sunday to bench with the rest of our top benchers. On the way to Tim’s, I had a talk about pain with Matt Dimel, my redheaded stepchild. He had a terrible injury to both knees and was having trouble with it, he felt the fear of pain. While driving I said, “Look you fat F’er, it is in your head.” Now I am waiting for him to smack me in the mouth, like he did many times. But nothing happens. He then says, “You’re right buddy. It is in my head.” I was relieved for a while. But, when we got in the gym, he started putting on wraps and all kinds of painers. I said, “I told you it’s in your head.” At that he came after me, all 370 lbs. of him, and ran me into a corner where about 10 eight ft. lights were standing. He drove me through them and into the wall, and all the bulbs went into my back. But, I had him by his long hair and beard and attempted to make him look like Linda Blair in The Exorcist. Meanwhile, he is kicking and punching me. After a while, he stopped and I let go of two hands full of hair. I go right to the bench and do my set. After getting up, there was blood all over the bench, and lots of glass stuck in my back. Like nothing happened. Until after the workout, Mickey Tate says to me, “Don’t ever do that again. You two scared me to death.” I laughed. Because Mickey had been in jail for shooting someone. That was Westside in the 90’s.\nDue day at Vanhorn’s, George went to out-bench the great Larry Pacifico, who I saw bench 590 at 228 in the early 1970’s. But that was a good reason to try it unofficially. KP jumped in like a good training partner. First George, then KP. 475, to KP’s 480. Then 545, to KP’s 550. Then 585, and KP made a strong 590 and called it a day. But George went on to his first 600 lb. raw bench. What a day. George said a great monument in his past was watching KP at John Inzer’s bench meet. George made 650 and missed 672 and then sat in the front row to watch KP make a 716 world record. But it was how he did it, George recalls it must have taken 10 seconds to lock out and win top coefficient bench over Clark. Then, a few weeks after KP made 728 to make him the greatest bencher of all time.\nJoe McCoy was one who thought that the weights might be light at the big money events, but after his opener he said to me, “The weights are real.” Eskil Thomasson came to visit Westside from Sweden a few weeks before the money meet because he did not believe that we trained like we said we did. I told him we were going to Texas for the meet and he said he would come along to report it in the magazine he was writing for. After the meet, he was sold and moved to Westside for 10 years, until he had to move back to take care of his mother. Eskil was bigger than me and he could not out-squat, out-bench, or out-total me. But, in his last meet with Westside, in York, PA, he said he would beat my 722 lb. deadlift. No way Jose. On his last try, he pulled 725 lbs. to beat me. And, while he was holding the deadlift, after the down signal, he said in his witches voice, “F you Louie Simmons.” It was a great day for him and myself to see him make that lift, we will both remember that day forever. Stay strong, Eskil, you fag.\nGeorge had a history of back problems and asked if it would be ok if he just did bench meets from here on out. He had already made an Elite Total. So I said, “Sure. You earned it.” George started losing body fat but kept his bench strong. He knew the gym was for trying new and improved ways to train, and we had the guys that could do just that. Westside was always evolving, through countless hours of intense work.\nThe gym had up to 155 lb. dumbbells, which no one could do 20 reps of. Or so I thought. I made 13 reps, KP could only do 16 reps, for some reason on a stability ball. I told George, when someone could do 20 reps with the 155’s, I would buy 175’s for the gym. I remember, George had just got off work and was in his work jacket when he came in the gym with the blacked-out windows. I told him if he could do 20 reps with 155’s, I would buy 175’s. George goes right over to the 155 lb. dumbbells and does 20 reps dead cold. I could not talk for once. The next week, we had 175 lb. dumbbells, for those who could do them.\nGeorge and KP were ruling the bench at Westside. But then an eccentric man came to Westside to erase a lot of records on the record board, who was this man? J. M. Blakely. He is the man behind the JM Press. I handed out 545 for 3 reps, of the now known JM Press, to him. And so we named it the JM Press. It is still a major part of our bench training at Westside.\nDave Waterman was one of our top rivals at money meets. Dave was the first 181 to bench 600 lbs. His 628 lb. record did not last long before George finally had a good meet. There was a bench meet in Lumberton, NC that offered $8,000. That was a lot of moola so I called them to be sure they really had $8,000. They said yes. I told them we will be down, and to have the money in small bills. Lumberton is a very small town where if you wanted to take a girl out to impress her, you took her to Denny’s. They had no idea who would show up for that kind of cast.\nWe had three world record holders. Plus Waterman showed up as well. The bench came from Kmart, it was about 8 in. wide, and the head ref. would only use 45’s. No 100’s on a Kmart bar. JM said it was like maxing out with a 3 in. cambered bar, it bent so much under heavy weights. First, Dave Waterman fell off the bench three times. He was gone. But, with our three world record holders plus JM and Mickey Tate winning the Masters, we took home all the cash. I did not think we would get out of that town alive. The head ref. hated me, along with his sister, or wife, or both, I’m not sure. I guess because I handed out to everybody. George had a bad day but came through for some cash. KP was always on. And Waterman always did great, but not on a slippery 8 in. wide bench. Our guys had always had it out for Waterman, after he had become the first 181 to bench 600 lbs., and said he not only was the greatest bencher, but also the best looking. We hated him, but at the same time, loved him for his talent and for being a great competitor. Much like a rabbit in track. But, we finally killed the rabbit.\nGlen Chabot also comes to mind as a great guy, and very strong. I think he had a 665 lb. raw bench at 275. He always had a lot to say, like if he did not win The Arnold he would retire. So when The Arnold came around, I walked up to him and said, “I heard you are retiring, Glen.” He got a big laugh out of that. And to answer the question, he retired.\nI hate kilo plates and here is why. In Daytona, KP called for 722 but was miss-loaded to 821. After getting a reload, it had taken too much out of him, and Waterman won, again.\nGeorge said he wanted to lose weight and go down to a lighter class. Jerry Schwenker, a national level bodybuilder with a big bench, helped George out with a diet. At the same time, he also built up his lockout. This was due to band training, now known as Combination Methods Training, a term coined by Dr. Mel Siff in Supertraining. One group was testing bands on the bench, mainly our top benchers, meaning world record holders. And Chuck V., Dave Tate, and myself in the squat and deadlift.\nBack to Daytona and Waterman again, plus the giant killer, Markus Schick, was in the house. This time George beat Dave, 650 to 628. KP made a 688 lb. world record at 220. Now, George went on a tear, on the next 9 attempts he made 8 world records. But, Marcus won best lifter. With Doug Heath, George, KP, and Rob Fussner holding world record benches, we were the most dominant benchers the world had ever seen.\nHow much is too much band tension? Just ask Westside. The saying goes, “If you live by the sword, you die by the sword.” Too much band tension hurt George’s peck, and also broke his best bench by 50 lbs. a couple weeks before he pulled out in the warmup room at The Arnold. Rob lifted and tore his peck completely off in his opener, and was then gone for good.\nAt about this time, Tony Ramos came to the gym and brought along Paul Keys to train. Paul was really a strong bencher. He made a 625 lb. floor press. And to add to the list, J. L. Holdsworth, one of the strongest full lifters I have ever seen. He could also floor press 625 lbs. In just four meets he made the fourth highest total ever made. But, an old back problem put him out of our great sport. Tony Ramos still holds the total and deadlift marks at Westside. He is known as the ninja, because of how he disappears and reappears all the time.\nI remember, at one point, Paul made 615, KP made 625, JM made 610, George made 625, Mike Wolfe made 620 (now 639), and Nick Winter made 700. All raw. McCoy did 515, but at 184 lbs. bodyweight. I was very proud of our men. Like many, George was convinced that board pressing was the key to a big bench. But, I told him, he must touch his chest, after all that is the hardest part of the lift for most. I got George to use a cambered bar with an 11/2 in. camber. Then in his next meet, he broke the world record twice, with 744 and then 766. No third attempt because he hurt his shoulder. This would be George’s last world record. It took a couple of years to recover to where he could do 535 for four reps.\nMatt Wenning was training at Westside and was closing in on 600 raw. But during a gym shootout, George’s peck was separated from the bone completely. George knew he could not compete again and felt he should leave the gym for good. I told George he is Westside, he and the men I have mentioned throughout this writing. And that he must stay and train others and teach them like he was taught, not only by me but by the other greats before him and his training partners. Matt won the raw shootout at Dave Tate’s gym that day.\nI remember, at The Arnold one day, we were leaving when I heard some young guy call out to me, “Mr. Simmons, Mr. Simmons, can I talk to you?” I said sure. He was going to Ball State and wanted to come train at Westside. I said sure. He wanted to learn what I had been doing since 1982, about the time he was born. He came to train, became very strong, and started a personal training business. He left Westside and quit competing in gear shortly after breaking the total record in the 308’s. It only lasted about three minutes. Then, his new training partner, Chuck Fouks, broke it with his monster deadlift, making 900 lbs. in just four meets.\nI am proud to say not only Matt trained at Westside, but also, Dave Tate, you made Elite Fitness. Jim Wendler of 5-3-1 Fame, although it does not add up, trained at Westside. Along with the Brandon Lilly and his cube system. And of course, Mark Bell and his Super Training gym. If there was a problem, it could be solved inside Westside, by someone, including Drex Welch, Gabe Reitter, and many, many others.\nA lot of this information came from George, as he helped me write this. Because I nearly died in ’91, I could not put things in proper order.\nIf you want to learn all about who built Westside, look for the next edition.",

I won the 220 class with a 1,950 total (the 3rd best at that time). I was recovering from a complete tear of the right bicep when I made a 733 squat, 462 bench, and bombed with a 672 pull. Then in West Virginia I made 765, 480, and 705. The 480 was my first top 10 bench and the squat was 17lbs off the world record by the late great Chip McCain. As usual it was a great day but at the same time a terrible day. I tore two holes in my lower abs and a tendon off my pelvic bone. I could not squat 95lb for a month after that. I was determined to go to the SR Nationals in Wisconsin and after my 722 opener squat I had to pull out with the same injury. While recovering, Garry Benford asked to bring Mariah Liggett into the club, at the time she was going to Ohio State for PHD in exercise Physiology. She became very strong at 132 and 148, pulling 484 at 132 which still stands on our board today.\nI remember seeing George McElroy lift against our guys for years but finally lost his battle with cancer. A great Westsider Brent Tracy brought George to a meet just before he passed. George was loaded with pain meds just to be there. What a man, he had nuts and there was no quitting in him. There were good meets and bad meets. Why?, we had no clue. Meanwhile, we brought in some new members. My lifetime friend Darrell Mayo, Tom Fay and his wife Fay Fay. Her real name was Terry, but at Westside, nothing was real. Dr. Gary Sanger and I would spend hour after hour talking training and how to bring our team up to a new level.\nI was squatting to a low box in the power rack with Mariah and Laura Dodd (a world record holder at 165) and I missed a 725 low box squat with just the two girls spotting. My dumb ass set the safety pins too low and got slammed and pinned between the box and the bar. Laura and Mariah had to unload the bar completely. After the realization I had hurt my back real f**king good, I went to a surgeon and he said he wanted to remove two disks, bone spurs, and fuse my back.\nI said no way Josè.\nI had to take 17 weeks off and it even hurt to lay down. This took me back to ’73 – a bad time. I had to do something to change what had just happened. We were missing something, but what? It turned out to be Science: I began by buying Russian Training manuals from Bud Charniga Jr. He told me that they were technical and classroom like for studies. I said that is exactly what I want! First it was A.S Prilepin’s chart on loading: how many sets at what percent, and how many repetitions at a certain percent. It changed everything. Next was the optimization of training loads. I quit western periodization and began using wave periodization by Arosiev and other Russian sports scientists.\nWestside only counts all time world records.\nWe never had women at Westside on regular training days, so they trained on off days. The girls kept coming to where they won National and World Championships. Mariah Liggett\nLaura Dodd\nSue Meany\nSusie Bedford\nCathy Shannon-Seitzer\nPam Crisp\nSue White\nTracie Tate\nVanessa Schwenker\nDenise Zabawski\nDoris Simmons These women are responsible for too many World Records to count. Westside only counts all time world records.My wife Doris broke world records in the squat, bench press, and total that stood for years after her bodybuilding career where she won Miss Ohio and second in a Miss USA. Sue Meany was the first woman to bench press 300 and squat/deadlift 500 in the same meet. This is a piece of Westside history that many (even our current members) don’t know.\nGarry Sanger made number one on the 1984 ranking. Matt Dimel came to Westside in the early 80’s with his friend Bob Coe who continued to help Westside up to the present. Matt was very close to me and was a wild child to say the least. He was also our first world record holder with a 1010 squat that held up for a long time. Gear was not very good even into the mid 80’s and knee wraps gave you more than a suit. John Inzer was making Groove briefs soon along with the first bench shirt: the Blast shirt, which may have given you 10 or 15lbs. Gear was for injury prevention as well as some performance. \"I hit Don on top of the head\"\nNew lifters were getting try outs and Don Dameron a close friend as well as a Westsider liked to fight. One day I hit Don on top of the head and after about 2 minutes Don arm- barred my right arm out of place. This was normal behavior at Westside. Marcus Marinelli who runs Strong Style MMA in Cleveland and Geno Cardi were always having wrestling contests with workouts. It was a rough place from 85 to 95 to say the least. I admire Mark very much: he stopped powerlifting and started MMA training and today he trains Jessica Evil Eye, Stipe Miocic and a good friend Victor Ventresca World Greco champ. Mark has completely dedicated his life to MMA and he will never quit. That means everything to me.\n\"Impact Westside forever\"\nA new lifter who would impact Westside forever was Chuck Vogelpohl. I was going to Toledo to get my 5th Elite Total and this was Chuck’s first meet. I was weighing in at 232 about 15 min outside of Toledo and started drinking Gatorade until I was over 242. After standing on the scale I was 240 and had to drink 3 more Gatorades to go in the 275’s. And yes, I made the 275 USPF total for Elite.\nNow on to Chuck: He was a National champion in 1987 and WPO World champion in 2007. On the way he broke many world squat records and constantly had the #1 ranking from 220 to 275. He was also just one of a few to win two divisions in the WPO, plus WPO World champ.\nChuck was a great training partner and made it possible for me to lift the weights I did in my 50’s. I came close to dying in surgery in ’91 and had to be trached and have chest tubes placed. After intensive care for 5 days and a couple more in the hospital, Chuck and my wife picked me up and drove me to the gym. This was Tuesday and I did not need to — to talk. So on Sunday I drove to the gym for speed bench, but Chuck said “you need to max out mother**cker. So I did. I made 350 with a hole in my throat and stitches in my side from the chest tubes.\nWelcome to Westside my friends.\nZippy\nA second training partner that made training a blast no matter how hard it was, was Dave “Zippy” Tate also known as the owner of EliteFTS. Dave was a super dedicated training partner. And by the way, Zippy was a personality that came out when training. We killed ourselves working on too much band tension to use for squatting.\nI hold these two men in high esteem to this day.\nJoe McCoy, Kenny Patterson, and Gerry O were three young lifters just starting to train, but all three found the highest place in powerlifting winning world championships and Kenny breaking many world records in the bench. When Kenny P. was 20 years old, we went to Dallas TX for an Inzer bench bash that was worth 10 grand to the best lifter. Everyone knew Anthony Clark would win the top prize and after the meet the total prize money for best lifter was 10 grand. They gave this to Anthony Clark but he was not the best lifter. It was a mistake and Kenny Patterson had won as we found out later. To his word, John Inzer made it right to the point of having a dune buggy delivered to Kenny’s house.\nAnthony Clark would be the first man to bench 800 pounds at the Arnold here in Columbus Ohio and it was my pleasure to help spot that lift.\nThree things really had an impact on me!\nWhile we are talking about the 1980’s, Three things really had an impact on me:\nFirst was Amy Weisberger starting to train at Westside in ’86. She would drive from West Virginia to Columbus three times a week to train as she was going to school but needed a change in her training. Her former trainer had said she was tapped out at a 716 total. I felt this was an insult to not only her, but me. After all, she was going to train at Westside. Well it was all over when Amy totaled 1,185 at 123lb BW and at the time was the all-time world record. Then she made 1333 at 132 BW. This is still the all-time best, and then she made 1440 at 148. While the 123 record has been broken, it was by a teammate Natalie Carr with a mind blowing 1265 total. Amy’s 148 total is gone too, but is owned now by another teammate Laura Phelps-Sweatt with 1565. And by the way, Westside holds the world’s best totals in the 123, 132, 148, 165, 181, and a world record count of well over 45 all time world records. Amy is still a Westsider going into 2015 and she has demonstrated what a true Westsider is. This includes sporting a Westside tattoo on her calf. It is my honor to have her as my teammate.\nMike Jester who came in ’86 is also still at Westside training with his brother Joe and the rest of the gang. He is also still making progress.\nHow f*cked up!\nThe second person I would like to talk about is Jimmy Seitzer. He started in my garage with zero heat and he got mad when I got a heater. Then I knew how f*cked up he really was. Jimmy was a bodybuilder but only weighed 150lb. He would powerlift with us, then do bodybuilding at other local gyms. The better his squat was the better he was. A 500 squat won him Mister OSU. With a 600 squat he was Mr. Ohio, when we squatting 700 plus he was Mr. USA and second and third in the Mr. —. He made two elite totals at 198 and 220 with a 733 squat, 413 bench, and 666 deadlift. Jimmy is alive and well and sells the Bandbell Bar. A longtime friend just like Amy and my old friend Darryl Mayo, we see each other often and will till death do us part.\nNitro\nThe third event is the sudden death of my first pit bull Nitro. We brought him home and the club in 1973, the year I made my first Elite. He saw me make all five Elite totals before he died in the gym. He was there for all of our workouts and never missed a single one. He let the guys put wraps on him, but Gino Cardi would always reward him with some donuts. After his death I had a logo of his likeness made with a chain weight around his neck. He is still alive in the minds of many at Westside and that is why he is our brand image. He is an Icon. Some people understand what it is to be a Westside lifter, while others are too engulfed in their own ego to ever fully understand what the early Westside pioneers who started in the garage had to do with our legacy today.\nMany ask how I look at Westside and what I expect out of a lifter:\nOne, the adventure of the dog back in the call of the wild. When he was on top he was on top, but if he went down, he was done.\nI have always believed the creed if a true Westside lifter is a scene in the Shogun’s Assassin where Ogami the assassin must ask his son Daigoro to choose between two objects that meant life or death. It goes something like this:\nLord Kurogawa was losing his mind as he aged and through that, his loyal assassin Ogami who had decapitated 137 men was going to kill him. Everyone was afraid of Lord Kurogawa except for Ogami, but Lord Kurogawa was afraid of Ogami. And that was the problem.\nOgami’s wife had a bad dream that Kurogawa’s Ninja was going to kill them. One night when Ogami was in the prayer room, the Ninja came to kill Ogami, but only his wife and three young children was at home. They attacked her and delivered what was to become a fatal blow. Ogami heard the noise but was too late. As Ogami held his blood soaked wife, she said “my bad dream has come true”. On her dying breath she you must save our child as she touched their son’s Daigoro face with blood soaked hands as she died. Ogami swept Daigoro up into his arms and to safety. In a moment of peace, Ogami is wearing his beautiful white prayer gown and places a beautiful ball in front of Daigoro along with his short sword stock in the floor. Ogami says to his young son Daigoro “you cannot understand my words but you must choose one. If you choose the ball you will join your mother in death, but if you choose the sword you will join me on the road to revenge.”\nDaigoro crawls toward the ball, but sees the sword and touches it with his little hands. Ogami grabs up his son, and that began a blood thirsty killing spree like no other.\nThat is Westside in the whole. If you grab the sword and do everything possible to do your best, you are a true Westsider. But if you choose to be soft, get the hell out mother*cker!\nOne who chooses the sword was Karen Sizemore, better known as Size Master. At one point she had the largest bench for a woman at 450 lb and a 650 squat. She was a loyal Westsider for a long time until an arm injury stopped her power career. She still goes to our meets and now spends her time dressing her dog Daisy in the craziest of outfits you have ever seen. Karen was and still is wacked but in a good Westside way. We will always remember her and she will die a Westsider in my heart.\nAnother lifter that made an impact on Westside was Jeff Chorpenning. He was tall for a 198 but made the 6th highest total in the 198s with 2,060 with little gear. He was consumed by powerlifting and being a powerlifter full time 24/7. I told him he must relax sometime, but he always had his sword out to draw blood until one day his mind blew up and quit. I saw it coming for a long time but he would not listen to me. It disappeared just as fast as you came.\nJimmy Seitzer had a part for the club about a year later. We were talking and he said he did not miss powerlifting, my reply was “powerlifting does not miss you either”. I realized then that some hold themselves in high esteem, much higher than others. But I guess self- respect is better than no respect.\nThis is really just a small taste of the 80’s and that was a long time ago….\nI have no trophies, only memories.\nNo internet, no cell phones, just a call maybe once a month for advice from some great lifters like Larry Pacifico, Vince Anello, Ernie Frantz, George Crawford, and many other greats in powerlifting. Everyone respected each other, but at the same time competition was fierce between them like Blacks Health World ran by John Black, and Larry Pacifico’s Elite Power Team Glass City in Toledo, Cincinnati downtown YMCA, and Central Indiana Weightlifting Club with Ronnie Hale.\nI always lifted alone in the 70’s, and we entered just a few meets as a team in the 80’s. I was solely consumed with making the top ten lifts. The first time I saw my name in the top ten was in 1972 for the squat, deadlift, and total. 1980 was my first top ten bench, and my first national championship trophy was in 1971 in Patterson NJ. My last national championship trophy was in 2000 at York Barbell. My last top 10 lift was in 2002 where I was 6th in the bench at 54 years old. My first SPF Elite was in 1973 in Toledo and my last was in 2011 with a 1,885 total at 217 BW in Knoxville TN. I have five circles on the back of my neck for making an Elite total for five decades. I have no trophies, only memories. I have lifted in warehouses and ball rooms: it made no difference to me and the crowds mean zero. It is my competitors I lift for. Without being tested no one can rise to the top. Be thankful and respectful to your training partners, they mean everything to your success as you mean everything to theirs.\nA flash to the past: I had no training partners and it was just me, a radio and a mirror in my basement. I was in Franklin Ohio near Dayton and had a 1540 total that was 8th in the top 10. George Clark could beat me by 40 or 50lbs and was a good friend coming to my house on occasion. I hated him with great respect at the same time. When George would come into a room, everyone would stop and stare. He was nothing but coal black muscles and I was invisible. Well sure as hell my total was 1555 and his was 1600. On the way home from the meet I didn’t get it: they were all over him like flies on a dead man. Why not me? I train hard I said to myself. I drove a couple more miles and thought “Do I really?”\nWhen I got home, I did more of everything: goodmornings, back raises, abs, everything. But I bought a book that changed my life forever, it was Jonathan Livingston Seagull. It is a simple book yet profound at the same time. The book is about a seagull that wanted to fly as fast as possible and this was totally against the elder’s thinking. But Jonathan kept trying until he was forced out of the flock. On his own he managed to fly 50mph, but thought there must be a limit. One day on the beach while training with an Elder gull named Ching, Ching said “Jonathan, you are a very fast flyer but you think a number is perfection, but perfection has no limits. Perfect speed is being there at the moment”. Chiang vanished and appeared fifty feet away in an instant, then vanished again and was back at Jonathan’s side.\nAs I read this, I realized that only I can hold me back.

Tom held the shot put record in 1973 at Buffalo. He also finished first in the shot put at the Eastern Michigan Invitational in 1972. Tom also had the opportunity to play pro baseball, but instead chose to train at Westside and achieve a PhD after receiving his Masters in Psychology, as well as a Law Degree from Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. He became a member of the American Psychological Association on The Ohio State Board. Tom came to stay with me for the first time in 1974.\nHe dropped off at least 10 bags of clothes and books, mostly books in my front room, and returned home for 8 weeks without a note of any kind. I found out later he had become very sick. But, he did come back for good. He married his girlfriend, Candy, and had two boys, Joey and Ethan, both of whom went to college as Candy obtained her PhD in Psychology. Tom was very strong to say the least. With a toothpick in his mouth, he benched 525 for three reps. He would do reverse hypers four times per week. In 1982, he became our first 800 lb. deadlifter. Sometime after that, he again became very sick and found he had kidney failure. It took forever for him to receive a replacement. Back then, it was a death sentence. But, Tom was strong and kept going for over 30 years. He eventually died from heart failure around 2010. He was a great man that left behind a great family and many friends at Westside. To get a picture of yourself on the wall at Westside, you must become famous, then die. I, with honor, hung the picture of Tom on the wall in the gym along with the likes of Bill “Peanuts” West, the founder of the original Westside in Clover City, California.\nAs well as George Frenn and Pat Casey, two of the greatest lifters of all time.\nEvery day I look at those pictures and wonder if my picture will hang along the past giants of powerlifting at Westside.\nLong live Tom Paulucci.",

The more I deadlifted, the more backward was my progress. Then, one day I read an article by Bill Starr in Muscular Development titled: “If You Want to Deadlift More, Don’t Deadlift”. I was confused. How could that work?\nBill discussed doing high pulls, power cleans, rack pulls, back raises, and so forth. I did not know, back then, that this was the conjugate system. It did not have an official name until 1972, which came from the research being done by Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky in weight lifting and track at the Dynamo Club in Russia.\nI had nothing to lose with my 525-pound deadlift at a body weight of 181 pounds, so I gave it a shot.\nBy February 1973, I pulled 670 pounds, at a body weight of still 181 pounds, and my squat went from 550 pounds up to 630 pounds, just 20 pounds off the all-time raw record held by Bob McGee. I was sold.\nI incorporated this Soviet system into the training programs of my Westside Barbell athletes in 1982. Since that time it has constantly evolved as we continue to improve our training methods. Thus far, to date, 21 male Westside lifters have performed deadlifts of 800+ pounds and seven female Westside athletes have performed deadlifts of 500+ pounds. Just as Bill Starr suggested in his article, we use squatting, deadlifting, and good mornings to improve our regular meet deadlift. Here’s how:\nSPECIAL SQUATS\nWestside rotates the use of an assortment of special bars and special squats. For special bars, for example, we may use such a 14″ cambered bar, a safety squat bar, or a bow bar. For special squats, for example, we may do front squats or Zercher squats (all special squats are performed on at least three different box heights). On max effort day we may front squat to a very low box with a very close or a very wide stance, which builds conventional and sumo competition stances in the deadlift.\nFor accommodating resistance, we use 40 to 400 pounds of chain. Bands are also used, ranging from 70 to 140 pounds, 250 pounds, 375 pounds, 440 pounds, and even up to 700 pounds of band tension for our strongest men. Concentric squats can also be done by starting the lift under the bar on a set pin in the power rack or by suspending chains. Occasionally, weight releasers are used with very heavy weight up to 300 pounds.\nGOOD MORNINGS\nGood mornings with a specialty bar are done in about 25% of the max effort workouts. While squatting and deadlifting are done for a single rep max, good mornings are done for a three or four rep max, arched-back style, for increasing the squat and sumo deadlift. Always arch the back, but round the mid to upper back on the eccentric phase, and then arch the back completely on the concentric phase. Wide or close stance, arched or rounded, they all have a place for developing a particular body part. Bands and chains can be used. Concentric style good mornings are used a lot at Westside. Single-leg style good mornings, with one leg in front of the other, will isolate the left or right side of the posterior chain. By the way, if you are doing a 500-pound good morning with a 450-pound deadlift, you are training wrong.\nDEADLIFTS\nWe do lots of deadlifts, of course, but not off the floor with just straight weight. We do a lot of band pulls with 220 pounds of tension at the top (for our lifters who pull 800+ pounds, we use 280 pounds of tension). On Fridays, after speed strength squats, we do 6 to 10 singles for speed pulls using a bar weight of 50% of 1RM + 30% band tension at lockout.\nWe may also do rack pulls against bands, conventional style, using approximately 250 pounds or 350 pounds of band tension at lockout. (Interestingly, my regular 1RM deadlift is 765 pounds, with the plates at 6 ½” sitting on the floor, and when I rack pull I use a bar weight of 515 pounds + 250 pounds of band tension–also 765 pounds total–at lockout.) Two other rack pulls are done on a regular basis with the plates 4 ½” and 2 ½” off the floor. Do not allocate more than 10% of your deadlift training to rack pulls or you will be wasting your time. (By the way, I found no advantage in using the lightened method, reversing the bands, when training the deadlift.) The power clean or power snatch can also be used.\nA trick Paul Anderson would use when deadlifting is to raise the toes onto a wooden ramp to overload the hamstrings. There are even special deadlift shoes with the toes elevated about ½” to change the center of gravity for better leverage, thereby placing the shoulders almost behind the bar. Paul would also elevate the heels to overload the lower back.\nSPECIAL EXERCISES\nFirst, train the abs hard and heavy. Then, be sure to train the lower back with light good mornings, back extensions, or stiff leg deadlifts with bands hooked in front to make the lockout difficult. Add in lat work of all kinds: rows, chins, you name it. Do them all and rotate often.\nGood Luck\nLouie Simmons",

However, Verkhoshansky used the term, “shock training.” Shock training covered many forms of training with resistance.\nBefore one begins to do depth jumps, the athlete must have a high level of strength and a high degree of G.P.P. (general physical preparedness). For well-conditioned athletes, 4 sets of 10 jumps are optimal, while 3 sets of 8 jumps are better for a less conditioned athlete. To build explosive power, a drop of 30″ to 36″ works best. The amortization phase is short (.2 of a second). To build absolute strength, much higher boxes (42″ to 52″) should be used, which will result in a much longer amortization phase. It’s the same type of situation when completing a reversal phase from eccentric to concentric. As weights grow heavier, the time between switching becomes slower.\nThere are many forms of plyometrics, such as bounding and jumping down to a surface, then up to a second box. To building generic jumping skills, jump up and down on every height box. To build concentric strength, jump from lower to higher boxes; for eccentric strength, jump from higher to lower boxes. Again, the amortization phase must be short (.2 seconds is recommended).\nFor the upper body, drop down into pushups, or catch a medicine ball and immediately throw it back to a rebounder or training partner. Bounding over hurdles or a box is a good option, while jumping rope is also a very simple plyometric exercise. Always warm up the muscles used prior to the workout.\nLet’s take a look at some additional forms of shock training:\nMAXIMAL ECCENTRIC\nThe idea here is that you are lowering a weight that is 20% over your best squat, bench, or pull. Olympic lifters would use slow eccentric to build the squat, because of a regular full squat after catching a clean. They fall into the bottom, and bounce up. For building concentric speed, use weight releasers with a combination of weight on the bar (60% on the bar, and 20% on the weight releasers). After lowering a total of 80% of your 1RM in this combination, the 20% on the weight releasers will come off the bar, leaving you to push up against the remaining 60% as you work explosive strength.\nRUSSIAN SYSTEM\nThis system utilizes the technique of strong electrical stimulation, which ultimately causes a stronger muscular contraction than an athlete can produce by themselves.\nRESTRICTED RANGE MAXIMUM\nThis is power rack work where one can lift a heavier weigh than in full range movements. High pin lockouts for the bench are very common. Quarter (1/4) squats with more than your best squat, or rack pulls from above the knees, as well as the standing press, can also be utilized. It is recommended that Olympic weightlifters never use more than 5% above their best snatch or clean. Following a similar guideline, never exceed 10% above your best powerlifts. Example: a 600 lb. deadlifter should never pull more that 660 (10% more than you can pull off the floor).\nCONTRAST METHODS\nOf course, this is one of my favorites. By using chains, it can make the top of many lifts much heavier than the bottom. Once can use anywhere from 40 lbs. of chain, up to 400 lbs. of chain if desired. Not only can chains cause an over-speed eccentric effect, but by using strong bands, the lifter can experience over-speed eccentrics as well. That’s a strong concentric phase by building a strong reversal effect, by using 25% band tension of your 1RM for speed strength (roughly .8 meters per second). For strength-speed (or slow speed), the tension must exceed the bar weight. Weight releasers fall into this category as well.\nFORCED REPS\nHere, one can assist his training partner in helping execute a few more full range lifts than would be possible otherwise.\nSUPER MAXIMAL METHOD\nHere again, bands can be used to add weight to the bar above your all-time max with just bar weight. So as you can see, there are many shock methods to rotate. They should be used on max effort day, and rotated each week for best results. When training with weight at 90% or higher for 3 weeks, you will have a negative training results. The Westside system for max effort rotates a barbell lift each week; four to eight should be cycled through. Pick ones that work best for making YOU stronger, while always keeping in mind this may not be the one you like best.\nShock training is not for novices. Along with isometrics, here are some helpful tips:•- use a wide variety of bars, for the bench, squat, deadlift, clean, snatch, and jerk•- changing the band tension, or the amount of chain weight placed on the bar•- remember the shock methods are performed on max effort day; 72 hours later, the speed strength or explosive strength must be performed for best results•- complete 3 or 4 special exercises after, for the muscles with the most potential\nI hope you understand the term “shock training method” better now; read Supertraining, by Mel Siff for further information.\nLouie Simmons",

Explosive strength for jumping, speed strength for the Olympic lifts strength speed for the deadlifts. Most important though is general endurance for simultaneous strength training.\nIn many ways Crossfit is a form of circuit training but some exercises are for endurance. Many are explosive strength like jumping and many are very heavy like deadlifting or pulling a very heavy sled across a football field, to doing hand stand pushups. So both strength and endurance must be improved simultaneously as well as increasing oxygen consumption as well as your anaerobic metabolism\nInjury Prevention\nStrength training builds not only muscular strength but also mechanical strength of the connective tissue, especially around the joints. For tendons and ligaments a strong muscle will absorb more energy than a weak muscle group. For weight training I recommend the Westside three week pendulum waves, going from 50% to 60% in a three week wave with 25% band tension at lockout.\n1st week – 12 sets of 2 reps2nd week – 12 sets of 2 reps3rd week – 10 sets of 2 reps\nRest intervals 45 seconds. If you squat 400lbs the weight ranges from 200lbs to 240lbs on the last week. This is 4,800lbs for squats. If you squat 300lbs your weights would be 150 – 180lbs. This math formula make it impossible to over train. Your deadlift could be trained the same way or the standing press or clean and snatch. For injury prevention only 20% of the weight training is with a barbell, 80% is with special exercises, mainly reverse hypers, leg press, shrugs and back extensions. A 400lb squatter should do roughly 16,000lbs of reverse hypers and 16,000lbs of leg pressing. These exercises work the body in single joint fashion which is much safer than high rep squats or deadlifts. This leaves time for chin-ups, jumps or upper body work like delt raises, front, side and rear. 10 sets of squats and 12 sets of deadlifts are done in around 20 minutes nonstop or 12 sets of cleans and 12 sets of snatches can be done in the same short time periods. Why so much attention on small exercises? To maintain proper muscle balance for prevention of injuries.\nBuilding General Fitness\nWhat is fitness? It is the ability to do every day activities much like a farmer or a manual laborer. Our style of lifting consist of pushing or pulling a strong man wheel barrow. The distance can vary greatly from 60 yards for football or any ball sports and including hockey. My experience with a third ranked Olympic triathlete was the same for endurance athletes she would warm up on a non-motorized treadmill or walking in a belt squat machine until her heart rate rose to 155 then a sled weighing 45lbs, 70lbs or 80lbs was pulled up to as much as 2½ miles or until her heart rate was 195 beats per minute. While the sled work increased her times on the bike, and running, swimming decreased constantly. This was her workout except for some triceps and pullovers. There are many methods to build running endurance but the sled is superior to all others. Power walk, never run, as running adds to momentum. With power walking each step is a start and it greatly reduces deceleration in all races from a 60meter to a marathon. Try pulling 45lbs or 90lbs on a sled while carrying a 40lb – 60lb medicine ball in your arms. This builds all endurance, muscular and oxygen consumption. A strong man yoke with different loads for a set distance ¼, ½ or one mile for a workout. This should be followed by jumping on to a box of low to moderate height for a 60 second drill. If you have a belt squat machine, walk in place for 1 up to 5 minutes with different weights for counting your steps. Also, carry a medicine ball while walking. By adding ankle weights or a Bulgarian bag of 20lbs up to 60lbs is a real test. More sled work calls for pushing a wheel barrow while pulling a sled behind.\nThe Zercher Lift\nLift a barbell held in your elbows off the ground for up to 20 reps, this is very tough but makes you ready for anything Crossfit can throw at you. To back up the zercher lift, do Ukrainian deadlifts. This is done with a kettlebell standing on two plyo boxes. High reps are in order for this one too. Lower the kettlebell as low as possible for a full stretch of the lower back, hamstrings and it also builds the abs. Even reps up to 100 is fine if your strength and fitness level will allow. A great workout is to attach a mini band or Bulgarian bag (20lbs up to 60lbs for the very strong) around your waist while doing your chin ups, or if you are too weak to do a chin up you can attach a band on top of the rack then place your foot in it to make a chin up or pull up possible until you are strong enough to do a real chin up or pull up. There is nothing wrong with doing barbell rows, dumbbell rows, low pulley or chest supported rows to build your pull ups, power cleans, snatch and deadlift. Up right rows are a very effective exercise to increase your pulling strength. Try pushing a prowler with an assortment of weight for different distances. Also, add ankle weights, weight vest or both for variety.\nMany Crossfit athletes come from a sport where circuit training was a main core of your training. This is common for wrestling. A common circuit would be dips for six reps then hurdle jumps for six reps, weighted sit ups for six reps, jumping squats for six reps, leg raises with weight for six reps and chin ups for six reps for example. This is for muscular endurance. A circuit can be done with machines, free weights and stretching as well. No rest between exercises. It is recommended to do 5 – 15 reps per station. Much like a Crossfit event where max strength and endurance is contested on the same day you can do a heavy set 80% – 90% for 2 – 4 reps then a light set of a different exercise for high reps 8 – 12 reps, this is certainly Crossfit to make yourself bullet proof. The small exercises like reverse hypers, back raises, high rep leg curls up to 200 a day and abs all the time will ensure your success for competing at the games.\nGood Luck!\nLouie Simmons",

Many ask, how does Westside train for a raw contest? The answer is simple, the same. Remember our system is based on physics, mathematics, and bio mechanics. The author trained ten years without a squat suit and fourteen years without a bench shirt. Yet, I was top ten with and without gear and you can be too Myths Most raw lifters use old fashion methods. One is western periodization, where one starts out with high reps (ex. 10 reps) and as the cycle goes week by week the reps become less and less until you are doing 1-3 reps a set. What’s wrong with this thinking? The high reps build muscle mass, but has little other value. Due to the light weights, you don’t produce hi force. As the reps go down you lose the muscle mass that you gained in the early stages of training. Now, by accident you build high force in the second phase or block. Now the close to contest phase is initiated, but with not enough volume to secure a hypothetical max, making it difficult to make an all-time record on meet day. Also, with the volume smaller and smaller it can lead to injuries.\nAfter the meet they start over by doing the same thing, hoping to get different results, that my friend is the definition of insanity. The Westside system calls for a 3 week wave for squatting and benching. It is based on your contest max. A max is a max, gear or no gear, man or woman, young or old. Burley trained at 50%, 55% and 60% for 12 x 2 week 1, 12 x 2 week 2 and 10 x 2 on week 3, with 25% band tension at lockout you build speed strength. Burley Hawk used 470-520 and 540 for a 3 week wave. He makes a 900lb squat very explosively, it’s the same wave a 900lb geared squatter uses at Westside. This is 10,800lbs of squats plus 3,200lbs of speed pulls with 220lbs of band tension at lockout. This added up to 14,000lbs on speed day or Friday. With the barbell, this represents 20% of our training and 80% is small special exercises, Reverse Hypers 40,000lbs, Plyo Pushes (Leg Press) 50,000lbs plus inverse curls, shrugs, abs, etc. Max Effort Training\nEach week max out on a rack pull with just weight or add 250lbs or 350lbs of band tension. Other lifts would be to stand on a 2 inch box or on plates with 220lbs or 280lbs of band tension and do sumo or conventional style, low box squat with specialty bars, one rack pull of some kind and one pull with plates on mats or standing on mats per month. The third max effort is a low box squat or a good morning. Almost always we have a deload workout, this means no barbell lift, only small exercises, for recovery. This is low volume, max intensity, the reverse of a speed day of high bar volume, moderate intensity. Speed Bench Press On speed day we use 40% of a one rep max with roughly 85 – 125lbs of band tension or 80-120lbs of chains. 9 sets of 3 reps with close to moderate grip. The bar must be very, very explosive for a fast rate of force development. This day is also used for the development of technicality, that’s 27 lifts that must be fast and perfect. Normally, after 3 weeks we either use a different bar, like a bow bar or a football bar and cambered bar with 2 ½, 3 ½ or 5 inch cambered. Remember, use 40% of a one rep max raw. So for Burley or any raw lifter, 40% is the weight to use on speed plus bands or chains. Two sets of dumbbells with a weight you can do 20 reps fairly easy for the two sets. Then triceps extensions with an EZ curl bar, a straight bar or dumbbell roll backs. The triceps are the most important muscles in the bench. We recommend about 60-75 reps in sets of 8-12 per set, but everyone is different, use our reps for a guideline only. Next is upper back and lat’s. This means a long list of exercises like lat pull downs, chest supported rows, low pulley rows, barbell rows, dumbbell rows, upright rows, the side delt work along with some rear delts. Don’t over-due front delt work, they can be over trained very easy, a w sets of hammer curls and that’s a workout. Remember This! Max Effort is the most productive day. It should be done 72hours after dynamic day. Westside’s speed bench day is Saturday and max effort day is on Wednesday. Pick a barbell core lift and max out, you must rotate each week. A random list would look like this… Rack Press on High Pin\nFloor Press\nIncline Press\nBoard Press (1-2-3-4 or 5 boards) Decline Press Rotate in no certain order, switch every week. All lifts can be used with at least two grips to break records with. After a max effort lift do similar special exercises for the triceps and upper back and lats.\nDon’t forget the hammer curls and your raw bench should roll. Good Luck!

Bob Hoffman was making an Isometric power rack at his York Barbell company. It was made very narrow, about 10 inches between up rights with 2 sets of strong safety pins. The bar would rest on the bottom pin then pull or push the bar upward to contact the second pin and hold for 3-6 seconds per set for several sets at about three positions for pressing and up to six positions for squatting and pulling. Remember this, application was for the Olympic lifts and not until 1972 was the press eliminated from the Olympics. The top soviet lifters also were using Isometrics at the same time. But too much of a good thing is not good, and much of the Isometric work was forgotten. This is a mistake and will expand. However, first what is Isometrics and what are the pros and cons of using them and where do they fit in with other muscle actions? DEFINITIONS BY MEL SIFF IN SUPERTRAINING, SIXTH EDITION: A study by Verkhoshansky in 1970 showed that Isometric work could be more effective then dynamic exercises (meaning with a reversal phase where maximum contractions over a large or full range of motion). Isometric exercises are to build absolute strength, but also other means of special strength. Before we review let’s look at the pros and cons of Isometric training. Advantages: 1. Not much equipment is needed. Example: a bar and a power rack.\n2. Building strength at a particular angle.\n3. It does not use a lot of training time.\n4. No weight gain.\n5. A six second contraction can be as effective as many dynamic contractions. Disadvantages Isometrics are not to be used before puberty or if one is a novice. Isometrics can fatigue the central nervous system. If done alone, a loss of some coordination will occur. Holding your breath for a long time can have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system. Now, let’s look into the methods Westside uses for its special training, or small workouts, lasting up to 25 minutes. This happens about 6 hours after a dynamic or max effort workout. I do Isometrics without a power rack. To build strength at the start, load a barbell to a weight that you are unable to lift off the floor. Now do six pulls for 3 to 6 seconds. Next, place the barbell on 6 inch boxes and repeat for six pulls for 3 to 6 seconds. Now, raise the bar to knee level and repeat the same sets and reps, two more levels are used, 2 inches above knee level and just short of lockout. For the six sets of 3-6 seconds, Isometric pulls can be done inside a power rack as well.\nOlympic lifting can benefit greatly from Isometrics, for not only strength gains, but checking technique at several positions, especially the critical second pull position. For squatting, place the bar raging for the very bottom to lockout with 3 or 4 stops in between. You must crawl under bar and use perfect form for six sets of 3 to 6 contractions. This is done with a power rack. For benching use 4 to 6 positions for the Isometrics and don’t forget standing, incline or decline pressing would use the same procedure for sets and reps.\nIt is hard to determine how much force you are exerting against an unmovable bar. A second variety is to hold a percent of a one rep max at different positions for 3 to 6 seconds. This was a common method for Soviet weight lifters. The coach would tell the lifter to hold at a certain position then pull up to a second position then hold. Sometimes up to four positions would be used in one set. A different version is to use two pins. Set the bar on one and press up against the second pin and hold for 3 to 6 seconds for 6 sets. This method is referred to as the Hoffman method.\nFor building explosive strength, generate force and work up to 70% – 80% tension as fast as possible. The static dynamic method is far superior to just dynamic work. Set the bar with an unmovable, strip weight to 30% of one rep max then press or pull as explosive as possible, weight releasers can be used. Hold weight releasers slightly off the ground then drop to activate weight releasers and push or pull explosively, or special devices can be used. A Static Dynamic Developer can be employed. After using Isometrics for six to eight weeks, one can reduce to workouts from 4 to 2 workouts and retain the same strength.\nAlways do a relaxing exercise for regaining flexibility and circulation.\nLouie Simmons References Kurtz, Thomas, Science of Sports Training, 2001\nSiff, Dr. Mel, Supertraining, 2003\nZatsiorsky, V.

A football player while in high school ran a 5.2 second 40 at 175lb, and after 6 months of training at Westside and a new bodyweight of 225lbs he ran a 4.7 at Penn State and I will close with this: A girl training for the US bob sled team came to train at Westside for 3.5 weeks. Her deadlift went from 305 to 365 in that time, and her progress in jumping in the power clean also improved greatly. But after making the team she injured a hamstring. Why? This is ridiculous to say the least.One of the problems is that they followed an old method of periodization. This method has three training periods: Accumulation, Intensification, and Transformation. In the accumulation phase, great volume is done for raising all levels of special strength and conditioning.\nIn the intensification phase the athlete uses mostly sports specific exercises as well as raising the intensity or speed of movements. The theory is this cannot last long or maintained for a prolonged period of time.\nIn the final phase of Transformation the athlete now aims for sports results while a small portion of exercises from the accumulation is done. Next, a detraining phase is performed for 4-6 weeks and an attempt to use low intensity exercises to raise volume is done. The ball players or track and field athletes then start over for next season starting back at the same level of sports performance as the before and start over again. This is ridiculous to me.\nI recently sent two track girls on full scholarships. At the end of the high school track season, one ran with a track club leaving all the general training behind. The result was a loss of muscle mass and a reduction in her running times for the 100-200 meter and 400 meter and her previous 50.5″ box jump regressed to 44″. The other girls stayed at Westside to train, but this was against her college coaches’ wishes. At her college track tests, she broke most of the school’s records (ie the med ball work and she had a vertical jump of 33.5″)\nWhile on track and field I trained a 70 ft 10″ shot putter and a 210 plus discus thrower and while at Westside no throws were performed, only special strength training. After going out west, only throws were done with no weight training. I called and asked how their throws were going: the reply?\nTERRIBLE. Why?\nThe strength in the correct muscle groups has been lost up to a possible 20%. This makes it impossible to use in the technical phase. People, you don’t retain strength, speed, explosive power, or even flexibility or mobility without continued training.\nAnd back to football…\nI recall when you could tell a football player by his neck, but not now. They seem to be afraid to work the neck like it should be worked. Also the other end of the spine – meaning the lower back- is also neglected almost entirely. This is where hamstring injuries happen. Weak lower backs mean weak hamstrings. Weak hamstrings means your players will tear them. It is important to learn how to train hard, but safe.\nCase in point: The steel curtain or the linemen of the early Pittsburg Steelers all could bench 500 or more pounds and high box squat 600 and 650 for reps. Ask yourself what has happened?\nThere is no need to start over. A group of wrestlers finished the regular season, but instead of doing nothing they went to a MMA club and practiced Judo, Samba, and Ju Jitsu along with the styles of wrestling. Of course they also maintained their conditioning that was shown for the three new disciplines by their instructors. A proud return to high school wrestling the next year made them not only in better shape than at the end of last year, but had also increased their technical skills as well. This is an example of correct training as used in the conjugate system.\nYou must change your training somewhat to avoid accommodation. If you continually use the same training over and over you will go backwards or go through a detraining period. In running, this is referred to as the speed barrier. This occurs after doing the same sport. No matter how fast you want to run, you simply can’t until you bring forth a new training stimulus to your program. This can be avoided by doing something many coaches seldom do:\nREAD A BOOKI am not criticizing but merely analyzing. Here is a small list to start with:1.

Since then, most world-record holders in the squat have trained by squatting on a box. Today, there are nine lifters who squat 1,200 pounds and at least seven are box squatters. I began box squatting in the late 1960s. In 1973, I squatted 630 pounds and deadlifted 670 at a body weight of 181 pounds. 27 years later, I squatted 920 pounds at the age of 52. Westside Barbell has 19 members who squat more than 1,000 pounds, and they all box squat. Every member of Westside Barbell does box squats year-round with free squats done only in competition.\nDespite this half-century history of box squatting by the world’s greatest lifters, I still consider box squatting to be a secret weapon because it remains a secret to most lifters and athletes. It’s also an exercise that is highly misunderstood and grossly underappreciated. Let’s see what I can do about that by giving you some reasons why you should be box squatting. 1. Box squatting produces less soreness, allows for faster recovery, and enables the lifter to train squats more frequently.\nThis is attributable to breaking the eccentric-concentric chain when the lifter sits down on the box, which in the world of physics is known as a “collision.” Although some of the kinetic energy generated during the eccentric phase of the lift remains stored in muscles such as the glutes and hamstrings, much of it is dissipated as a result of the collision. The loss of kinetic energy and any loss in stretch reflex in muscles that relax are the primary factors that determine the difference between the weights a lifter can use in a conventional free squat as compared with when squatting on a box of the same depth. We have determined that this difference is about 15% less. Being able to use less weight to produce a heavier squat on meet day is also an advantage. 2. Box squatting is safer.\nWhen box squatting, the lifter uses less weight and is forced to use better form, which reduces spinal compression. Filling the abdomen with air when box squatting creates optimal abdominal pressure that also protects the spine. Properly performed box squats have also been shown to reduce spinal loading at S5-L1. Box squatting is also safer for the knees because the perpendicular shin position reduces pressure on the patellar tendons.\n3. Box squatting places greater load on the larger, major squatting muscles of the hips, glutes, and upper hamstrings.\nBox squatting allows for a wider stance and emphasizes squatting back by driving the glutes rearward, rather than down. This enables a deeper squat and the lifter to sit far back on the box, putting the glutes and hamstrings in a stretched position and the shins at or past perpendicular to the floor. The angle of the shin places a greater load on the glutes, hamstrings, and hip flexors. These are the major squatting muscles, the main muscles for sports performance, and the most commonly underdeveloped areas of a person’s legs.\n4. Box squatting ensures that all squats will always be below parallel and teaches perfect squatting technique.\nWhen free squatting, the lifter often doesn’t squat to parallel when warming up with lighter weights, just as there is an invariable tendency to squat higher as weights become heavier. This is eliminated during box squatting because the lifter sits down onto the box. Once the lifter has established a below parallel height for the box, all squats will be below parallel. Box squatting also teaches perfect squatting technique by allowing the lifter to sit completely back and not down while descending and by removing the speed aspect from the bottom of the lift.\n5. Box squatting builds greater absolute and explosive strength, as well as developing tremendous pulling power in the deadlift and extraordinary jumping ability.\nTwo proven methods incorporated in box squatting for the development of absolute and explosive strength are relaxed-overcome-by-dynamic work and static-overcome-by-dynamic work. These methods describe the action of the major muscle groups involved in box squatting when the lifter breaks the eccentric-concentric chain. When the lifter sits down on the box, some muscles are relaxed while other muscles are held static. These relaxed and static states are then overcome by dynamic concentric contraction at maximal force when jumping off the box. This increases the rate of force development (RFD). By breaking the eccentric- concentric chain, box squatting produces a rate of force development (RFD) three to four times greater than other types of squatting and builds tremendous starting strength in the major muscles that dominate sports performance. Deep box squatting also develops explosive pulling power off the floor in the deadlift and increases jumping ability substantially. (Westside’s best box jump is 63 1⁄2 inches as of August 2012.)\n6. Box squatting will make you a better athlete.\nExplosive strength is an absolute requirement for all competitive athletes. An exceptional rate of force development (RFD) means greater acceleration, giving you an edge over an opponent. The static and relaxed-overcome-by-dynamic actions of box squatting will make an athlete strong, fast, and explosive.\n7. Box squatting doesn’t require any gear.\nAlthough as far as shoes go, Converse Chuck Taylor shoes are the best for squatting. (Don’t have $100 shoes and a 10¢ squat.)\nThose of you who weren’t already box squatting before you read this article, I’m sure you’re now asking yourself how you’ve managed to get this far in life without it. Now that you’re ready, you need to know how to box squat correctly. So in the next Article I’m going to tell you everything you need to know to start box squatting the Westside way.\nStay Strong\nLouie Simmons",

He based his information on practical experience with his athletes (Over 1500 powerlifters, athletes, and coaches trained in person at his gym). After ten years of experimentation, he published his first strength training article in a print magazine called Powerlifting USA and later moved from print to digital media and made his articles and blogs available online for all to read. Louie's content has been and still is a vital resource for many looking to expand their knowledge. Westside Barbells' role as a strength-education company is to ensure that this legacy of information stays relevant and available to all. I aim to build on current articles, where needed, with unpublished data from Louie's archive and any new developments made within the gym, our network of coaches and athletes, or the strength sciences. This article and blog update will allow me to simplify or build upon topics asked by our community. The goal is to further enable all visitors and followers on their strength training journey by providing more insight into the genius of Louie Simmons and our strength training methods.\n- Tom How To Do a Box Squat Properly!\nIn the last Article, I gave you about a dozen excellent reasons why you should be box-squatting (and hopefully cleared up any misconceptions you may have heard about box-squatting). I also told you that every member of Westside Barbell does box squats year-round (with free squats done only in competition), including the 19 Westside lifters who can squat more than 1,000 pounds. Convinced?\nYou don’t see box squats commonly performed in the gym because the majority of even the most experienced lifters don’t know how to do a box squat correctly. I will now tell you everything you need to know to do box squats the correct way—the Westside way\n-Louie Simmons BOX-SQUATTING TECHNIQUE THE WESTSIDE WAY I will first teach you Westside box-squatting technique and then some fundamental Westside box-squatting methods, so you know how to incorporate box squats into your strength-training program. Anyone can sit down on a box and stand back up, but you have to apply science to the specific execution of the lift. You must learn the systematic procedure to correctly execute the mechanics of the box squat and also become proficient and in command of its execution. After all, if you don’t plan on doing something perfectly, why do it at all? Let’s begin. CORRECTLY POSITION YOURSELF FOR THE BOX SQUAT 1) Set your stance. You should set your stance as wide as possible, with your knees pushed out to the sides and your feet pointing straight ahead or slightly outward. Using a wide stance when squatting will place greater stress on the posterior chain (glutes, hips, hamstrings, and back) where it belongs, not on the quads (it’s a common misconception that the quads are the most important for squatting maximal weights).\n2) Set yourself to the bar. Get under the bar, push your neck into your traps, and position the bar in the groove of the upper back (not above the traps). Pulling your shoulder blades together may help you maintain the proper position of the bar. With a wide-hand monkey grip on the bar, pull the bar tightly into your traps, while pulling your elbows up and under to engage the lats (do not flare your elbows out).\n3) Set your core. Now that your upper back is tight and you are positioned for the lift, you’ll need to tighten your midsection. Expand your abdomen (not your chest) by taking a deep breath through the diaphragm, pulling as much air as possible into your abdomen by pushing your belly into your lifting belt. In order for the power from your lower body to be maximally transferred to the bar, your abdominal muscles must be tight throughout the entire lift.\nThis will also stabilize and support the lower back. If your core isn’t tight, there will be an unnecessary dissipation of kinetic energy through the core, in addition to the inherent loss of kinetic energy resulting from the collision that occurs when you sit down on the box. This will translate to an overall reduction in kinetic energy and stored stretch reflex that contributes to your ability to explode off the box as you initiate the concentric phase of the lift.\n4) Lift the bar from the rack. With the core as tight as possible, lift the bar out of the rack by arching your upper back, lifting your chest up as you drive your head back, then pushing the bar up evenly with your legs. To box squat correctly, you should also be forcing your knees out to the sides and pushing out on the sides of your shoes, never downward, as though you are trying to spread the floor apart. This is to further activate the hips. You are now ready to descend into the eccentric phase of the lift. THE ECCENTRIC PHASE\nDESCENDING ONTO THE BOX The eccentric phase begins by breaking the hips first, not the knees. You do this by pushing the glutes and hips rearward (then follow with the head) as you push your feet and knees out, thus forcing you to sit back (not down, or your quads will dominate). This is the only way to activate your hips and glutes to their full potential, to ensure maximum involvement of the posterior chain.\nBy sitting back, rather than down, you place the glutes and hamstrings in a highly desirable stretched position. While descending to the box, continue to keep your head and chest high, maintain a tightly arched back, and be sure your core is as tight as possible by keeping your abs pushed out until you are sitting on the box. THE STATIC/RELAXED PHASE BREAKING THE ECCENTRIC-CONCENTRIC CHAIN\n(SITTING ON THE BOX) The static/relaxed phase begins when the backs of your legs come in contact with the box and you’re sitting down completely on the box by rolling back onto it. (Note: This does not mean rocking on the box, dropping down on the box, bouncing off the box, or doing a touch-and-go on the box).\nYou should immediately release (relax) the hip flexors while keeping the rest of your body tight, especially keeping the remaining squatting muscles of the posterior chain very tight during their brief static contraction on the box (this will preserve stored kinetic energy and stretch reflex not dissipated from the collision with the box). You have now broken the eccentric-concentric chain. Your back should remain arched, the hamstrings and glutes stretched, and the abdominals as tight as possible.\nThe shins should be straight up and down (perpendicular), or even past perpendicular, placing all the work that’s about to happen within a matter of a second or two when you begin the concentric phase of the lift directly on the hamstrings, glutes, hips, and spinal erectors (lower back).\nThe momentarily relaxed state of your hip flexors and the momentarily static, stretched state other squatting muscles of the posterior chain are about to be overcome by being engaged all in unison in an explosive dynamic contraction in which you leg-curl yourself off the box into the concentric phase of the lift. These static/relaxed-overcome-by-dynamic-work methods are the cornerstone of why box squats are such a powerful lift for the development of absolute and explosive strength. Now it’s time to jump. THE CONCENTRIC PHASE ASCENDING FROM THE BOX After you pause on the box, continuing the correct box squat form begins with the concentric phase of the lift by ascending from the box in an explosive manner in which you simply reverse the sequence of movements in the eccentric phase. This means the head moves first, followed by the glutes and hips. Specifically, begin by being sure your core is tight by pushing your abs out against the belt, then driving the head and upper back into the bar, which engages the spinal erectors and allows you to forcefully flex the hips, glutes, hamstrings, abs, and finally quads while you arch the upper back, drive the feet outward, push straight up into the bar, then jump off the box by leg-curling yourself up.\nNow that I have taught you correct Westside box-squatting technique, it’s time to teach you some fundamental Westside box-squatting methods, so you can put your newly acquired skills into practice in your strength-training program. Benefits of Box Squatting Correctly\nBox squats, first and foremost, are one of many squat variations. They are a staple of our training system, but that does not mean we avoid other variations, such as the free, front, and overhead squats. When taught and executed correctly, box squats can be safer and more effective for athletic development than free squats. Implementing a box will have the following benefits.\nIt will break up the eccentric/concentric chain.\nSitting on the box causes a collision, which forces you to lose momentum and makes standing back up with the weight more challenging. The loss of momentum occurs because when the glutes meet the box, they dissipate kinetic energy obtained when descending in the squat(eccentric). Help reinforce technique and posture.\nBy having a box, you create an environment that allows for more accurate repeatability of a movement. Since depth and stance will be constant, you will quickly feel or see if your technique is off. When free squatting, the ability to compensate to achieve the lift is much higher.\nAllow for more predictability in squat depth. The box height accurately indicates how low you are, ensuring you are constantly hitting the desired depth every time. It dramatically reduces the force placed on the knees.\nThe position of the shin angle during a correctly performed box squat reduces the internal pressure on the patellar tendons. The shin angle, accompanied by the correct box height, is a tag team that will save your knees.\nIt helps increase the opportunity for more muscle utilization. Using a box allows the opportunity to squat wider than a traditional squat. As a result, the hips, glutes, and hamstrings are more active. Box squats are great for nearly every training demographic, as they will help to reinforce positive squat technique while building a solid base of muscle development. However, strength training novices should learn how to free squat correctly before making a full or part-time switch to box squatting. This learning period will teach the full range of motion available, give an understanding of the general exercise mechanics, and provide an exercise to compare form and results.\nHow to Box Squat Correctly Variations\nWhat variations exist, and how do they differ from the typical box squat?\nYour imagination only limits many variations of box squats. The most significant difference between a traditional box variation and the others is how the weight loads on the body. Dumbbell box squat\nA dumbbell box squat is an excellent exercise for those looking to add weight to the bodyweight box squat without placing a barbell on their back. Stand in front of a box holding a pair of dumbbells with one side of the dumbbell head resting on your shoulder. As you perform this exercise, keep your knuckles pointing to the ceiling and elbows in front of you. Start by pushing the hips back to sit back and down on the box. To stand up, press out on the sides of the feet as you squeeze the hamstrings and glutes without letting the chest or elbows drop down. Kettlebell Box Squat (Double KB)\nThe Kettlebell Box Squat is an excellent option for those wanting to perform the box squat with more weight without putting a barbell on their back. You can also use this for circuit training where you perform back-to-back exercises (kb box squat, kb swing, etc.) A kettlebell box squat is performed with the kettlebell sphere resting on the forearm & bicep, wrist straight with the upper back squeezed tight and your chest up. Keep the elbows in front of the ribs throughout the whole movement. Front Box Squat\nThe front box squat is an excellent selection for those who want to use more quadriceps (front leg muscle) and add variation to traditional front squats. A front box squat is a front squat performed as a box squat. The barbell will rest on the front of your shoulders with two ways to hold the bar. You can hold it with the elbows pointing up in front of you as you bend the wrist holding the bar with the fingertips. Another way to hold the bar is to have it resting on the front of the shoulders with the arms crossed (right hand on the left shoulder, left hand on the right shoulder). As you hold the bar in either front squat position, you will move the feet in a slightly wider than hip-width stance. This exercise will force you to keep the torso upright as the weight in front of you for the movement. Bodyweight Box Squat The bodyweight box squat is an excellent exercise for those new to lifting or those that need to learn the technique of box squatting. The bodyweight box squat is performed with the same technique as a regular box squat but with no additional weight. Low Box Squat A low box squat is a box squat. However, instead of sitting on a parallel box, it will be much lower below (2-6 inches). You can use a variety of barbells, dumbbells, or kettlebells with a low box squat, but you may need to reduce the weight used due to the increased range of motion. High Box Squat\nThis exercise is a good choice for those limited in mobility or rehabbing from injury. To execute this exercise, a person squats on a box 1 to 8 inches above parallel. SSB Box Squats\nThe SSB box squat (also pictured in the low box squat photo and video above) is an excellent choice for athletes as it will allow them to perform the box squat without any discomfort they might feel from a straight bar. Another benefit of using the SSB box squat is that the SSB can help address a weakness in the upper back due to the camber the SSB has. Cambered Bar Box Squats\nThe camber in this bar makes it feel like a straight bar as it sits across the upper back while placing the shoulder joint in a better position. The hands are positioned much lower to the side of the ribs than a traditional straight bar. The cambered bar also places the weight plates closer to the center of gravity and forces the athlete to brace his core to avoid the barbell swinging. Goblet Box Squat\nThe goblet box squat is an excellent choice for those who have progressed wanting to add weight from the bodyweight squat without placing a bar on the back. To perform this exercise, you will stand in front of a squat box holding a kettlebell or dumbbell in the palms of your hands at the higher chest level. You will descend to the box from this starting position and ascend without lowering the kettlebell. Common Mistakes & Corrections\nBox squatting correctly is different from free squatting; when mastered, it eliminates nearly all the mistakes that impede progress. This misinterpretation leads to one of the most common mistakes in box squatting, as you must understand how to descend to \"sit\" on the box. Before we dig into some of the most common mistakes made, I will provide a quick basic recap on how to box squat.\nQuick How To Box Squat Correctly Recap\nIf you are box squatting correctly, the lift begins with hips moving back, like sitting on a chair, rather than breaking at the knees and dropping straight down. As the hips push back horizontally, you will simultaneously start to try to sit down until your glutes contact the top of the box. Now your goal is to unload only some of the weight into that position. Instead, you will only unload the minimum tension required to relax your hips before you begin the accent. Bouncing Off/Tap and go squatting At Westside Barbell HQ, we receive many videos of people requesting advice or input on their exercise techniques. The biggest mistake viewed of all the box squats sent in is of individuals who squat straight down and bounce or tap the box with their glutes instead of sitting back and unloading some force into it. This incorrect interpretation of box squatting leads to the highest number of lower back injuries. It is one of the primary reasons a box squat gets misjudged as dangerous. Wrong Box Height\nSquatting to a very low or very high box is another common mistake. The goal is to choose a height 1 to 2 inches below parallel. (A parallel squat position is when the hip crease is in line with the knee) When to squat low: Any healthy individual can squat to a low box without becoming dangerous. However, make sure that it does not disrupt technique/form. We usually rotate in max effort low box squats, and speed squats 2 to 4 times a year. When to squat high: A high box squat is usually done during rehab when the full range of motion is unavailable. Very rarely do our athletes use a high box in training as it does not yield the highest carryover to performance. Poor Posture\nThe upper back and shoulders are often rounded at the start of a lift, making the ascent aspect much more complicated and increasing the chance of injury. To fix this, before unracking, create a solid wedge between your upper back and the bar, pull your head back into alignment and crank your elbows down, as this will help to keep your upper body as vertical as possible. When ascending, look up at the highest comfortable spot possible this will also help maintain good posture.\nKnees\nOn the ascent of a box squat, we often see knees caving inward to execute the movement. To fix this, we usually use the following external or internal cues: Knees Out\nSpread the floor\nOpen The cue's goal is to reinforce that you should drive your knees out to the side rather than cave them in, which will significantly reduce the risk of injury and help elicit strength gains.\nLack of control\nKeeping control of the movement is hugely important. Refrain from thinking that performing it faster means you are stronger. You should only move as fast as you are technically proficient, or you will create bad habits leading to extensive injuries\nHow to Program the Box Squat Correctly\nCreate a sample program for the inclusion of Box Squats if possible\nTo give you a head start on how to utilize box squats within your training, here are some examples done at Westside Barbell. Dynamic Effort day is the home to the majority of our box-squat volume. Add accommodating resistance (resistance bands or steel chains) to any of these three-week waves for optimal gains. Remember to change to a new wave every fourth week. Regular Box Squat Wave\nWeek 1:\nBox Height: 1 inch below parallel\nSets: 12\nReps: 2\n% of Bar Weight: 50% of your 1-rep maximal on that lift.

Next, there needs to be a strength coach that uses a rotation of special exercises to develop the most powerful sprinter possible. It’s common to use a periodization plan consisting of building explosive and speed strength during a weekly plan, along with a max effort day for maximal strength. A lot of hypertrophy work is also added in the precise muscles that are responsible for sprinting: hamstrings, calves, glutes, hips, and the muscles of the torso and back, to maintain proper center of mass. I feel many make the mistake of using three training periods. The first period is: Accumulation. Here, there is high volume and speed in all movements. These movements should be easy for the athlete to maintain, to develop individually stable speed.\nThe second period is: Intensification. Now, the athlete moves into sport-specific exercises, directed toward his or her sport. This is where more explosive power and a greater amount of unstable speed development occur. To maintain unstable speed, it requires longer rest periods than time of work.The third period is: Transformation. This is where the work of the first two periods turns into sport results. At the end of transformation, the highest sport results should be obtained. It lasts for 14-21 days with the highest results possible, followed by 4-6 weeks of detraining, but with low intensity and added volume. At Westside, we certainly believe in this style of periodization to some extent; however, an athlete cannot take vacations- not even a short one. A pyramid is only as high as its base. The Westside system is a multi-year journey to sports excellence. Track and field has a high injury rate. This can be resolved by a large base of special exercises that make a nearly indestructible athlete. Hamstring, glute, knee, and foot issues plague sprinters and jumpers. S.P.P. and G.P.P. should be blended together to raise sports results. While a low volume of corrective running and jumping should be continued (about 20%), special exercises must make up 80% of the work. Special exercises will perfect sports technique, making it possible to perform a task to perfection, making it much safer.\nPowerwalking with the sled is the Tai Chi of weight training. To build a strong sprinter or jumper, first make long strides with the feet close to the ground, using the heels to pull the body forward. This builds the glutes, hamstrings, hips, and calves. Sixty yards works best for sprinting, as well as the dash in football. Complete eight trips with heavy weight on Monday; reduce weight by 1/3 and add trips (10-15) on Wednesday, then reduce the weight again on Friday. Monday builds absolute strength, and Wednesday strength for dynamic endurance, while Friday is for a warm-up or restoration.\nFor sprinting technique, stay on the balls of your feet. Sled work can be used for any race length. If you’re a long distance/ marathon runner, get your heart rate up to 190 bmp. The sled work will build great muscular development where it counts. Walking in a belt squat machine with weight around your waist will build your hips and glutes to the highest degree. It’s best to belt squat for a set that equals the length of your event (i.e. 60m- 8 seconds; 100m- 12 seconds, etc.). To build general endurance, do 60 reps per set, with one rep per second for a series of sets, with appropriate rest intervals.\nWestside also relies on a non-motorized treadmill for intervals, like power sled walks. Rotate the three to avoid accommodation- special exercises must play a role in sprinting and jumping. Glute-ham raises, inverse curls, reverse hypers, an assortment of ab work, including leg raises for the ab and hip tendons are a few. You must use ankle weights, hand weights, weight vest, kettlebells, and Bulgarian bags for resistance for walking, sprinting, and jumping.The key elements are speed strength squats on a box. Use a 3-week pendulum wave from 50%-60% percent of a 1RM. Add bands to the bar equaling 25% at the top of the squat with band tension. This adds 75-85% at the top with bar weight and band tension combined. It is a combination of explosive strength and speed strength; the bar speed should be .8-.9m/s, around 18 lifts total.\nFollow the squats with speed sumo pulls with 50% bar weight and 30% band tension at lockout for 4 sets of 2 reps, then move on to reverse hypers, glute-hams, or inverse curls. By gripping the bar in the deadlift, you utilize many different movements, as Coach Barry Ross discovered. Next, do 40 resistance jumps twice a week on different height boxes. For restoration, do 200 reps a day on leg curls, using 10 or 20 pound ankle weights. This also builds thicker connective tissue for more storage of kinetic energy, resulting in more rebounding.This is just a quick summery; look for our GPP and Explosive Power DVD’s,\nLouie SimmonsWestside Barbell Rules",

What are some reasons for this happening?– Not pushing out on the feet; this causes the knees to go out– Rounding over; just because you are bending over does not mean your hips are going lower– Not pulling the elbows forward and arching both the upper and lower back; this must be done to keep the bar over the hip joint, or as close as possible to ensure greater leverageWhen you do hit parallel, you must push against the bar, not the floor. After all, you are trying to lift the bar so that is what you must push against first. If not, you will find yourself in a good morning position, placing undo stress in the lower back and ultimately causing poor leverage as well. Converse® Chuck Taylors are the best shoe. Why? Their soles are completely flat, allowing the lifter to push their feet out to the sides.Placing a band in front of your power rack or monolift and attaching them to your bar will teach you to arch your back and push your knees out automatically. This will build both a stronger back and perfect form. Again, be sure to drive your back into the bar so you are conscious of not getting into a good morning position.\nFinally, you must box squat. Why? If your box squat is at or below parallel and you sit on it properly, you will be breaking parallel every rep. You can also sit back on a box to a point that your shins are past perpendicular; this puts the load on the hamstrings and hips. This is impossible to do in a regular squat, because you would be called over backwards. The two greatest methods of explosive strength and absolute strengths are static overcome by dynamic actions, and relaxed overcome by dynamic actions. Box squats do both. SPECIAL EXERCISES\nAt Westside, the ratio between the classical lifts and special exercises is 20% : 80%. The selection of exercises is the most important part of each workout. Always remember: It does no good to be strong in the wrong exercises.\nFor the bench, the triceps must be the strongest muscle group. They must fire before the pecs and delts to reduce injury. Yes, the pecs and delts must be strong, but the triceps should start the press and finish it at lockout. For the triceps, include extensions with a straight or EZ curl bar, dumbbell rollbacks, or extensions with elbows out to the sides. Exercises for all muscles of the upper back should be next, including the traps, rear, side, and some front delts, and lats.\nFor squatting and deadlifting, the glutes, hamstrings, and hips are the most important. Reverse Hypers, glute-hams, inverse curls, leg curls of all types should be included- but don’t forget abs! The abs must start every lift. That is why you take a deep breath in before starting the bench or standing press, squat, or pull. You cannot train what you enjoy, but what you need. Don’t train in the wrong pattern. Give the most attention to the lacking muscle groups first, and dedicate the least amount of work to the strongest groups. This will balance out your body and eliminate injuries.\nPERIODIZATION\nWestside has two days each for pressing, and the squat/deadlift. They are separated by 72 hours. One day for each is intended for speed and acceleration, while the other is for max effort. What makes the two days different? The speed day is high volume, with low to moderate intensity; the max effort day is low volume with maximum intensity. On a speed day, a 600 lb. max squat would require one to do 7,200 lbs. of squats on the third week (also the heaviest week) of a three week wave (10×2= 3,600 lbs. = 60% of 1RM); each rep would be completed in .8 m/s.\nIn comparison, on max effort day to work up to that 600 lb. 1RM, it would look like this: 315×2 (=630), 365×2 (=730), 405×1, 455×1, 505×1, 560×1, 605×1 for a total volume of 3, 890 lbs. That is close to 50% of the total speed strength volume from Week 3. On speed strength work, one must apply form to develop power.\nMax effort day’s goal is to lift as much as possible without a time limit. The speed strength runs in three week waves, adding weight from 50-60% or add chain weight to band tension for squatting.On bench speed-strength day, work with 40% of your 1RM all the time with the bar weight, but change from chains to bands to both. The rest period should be short- 45-60 seconds between sets is optimal. After the barbell workout, do three or four special exercises, regardless of the lift you just completed.\nWe have covered some of the most common problems a lifter has to deal with… but there are many more. Beware!\nLouie SimmonsWS Rules",

Everyone knows about Westside squatters, but what about their jumping ability? How about a 63.5″ box jump, backed up with a 63″ and a 60″.Jumping is the definition of explosive power- not Olympic lifting, which is a speed strength sport. Explosive power is performed at fast velocity. It is the ability to rapidly increase force (Tidow 1990). The steeper the increase of strength in time, the greater the explosive strength.\nSO HOW DO YOU DEVELOP THE EXPLOSIVE STRENGTH IN THE GYM? There are several parts to explosive strength development; first, let’s look at speed squats and sumo deadlifts.\nThe squats are done in our three week pendulum wave. Week one, we work with 50% bar weight of our 1RM, 55% in week two, and 60% in week three. Then, we drop back to 50% and start the wave over.However, you must also use bands on the bar, with the weights. The band tension should be 25% at the top (because of band sinkage, add 10% to that in the bottom of the lift). The bands will force you down faster than just weight alone, causing an increase in the kinetic energy. This is the key to reversal strength.\nThe average set/ rep breakdown per workout is 8 sets of two. Immediately following, we then do 6 set of 2 for sumo- style deadlift. For the deadlift, we are also working with 50% bar weight of 1RM, adding bands with 30% tension at lockout (adding 10% in bottom). You will learn that not only will this build a strong finish, but also a strong start, as one must overcome the additional tension at lockout.\nFor the squat wave, the bar weights range from 50-60% of a 1RM, and the top band tension is 25%. This addition turns 50% to 75%, 55% to 80%, and 60% to 85% at lockout. The data from 780 top European weightlifters performed by A.D. Ermakov and N.S. Atanasov show that 50% of the training for speed strength is trained at 75% to 85%. As you can see, this system is well planned, combining explosive strength in the bottom and speed strength at the top. The data chart can be found in Managing the Training of Weightlifters, by N.P. Laputin and V.G. Oleshko (copyright DCD Chanigas).\nThe next part is jumping itself, but against resistance. The jumps are done with ankle weights, weighted vests, kettlebells, and combinations of the three jumps twice a week work well for most. Establish a record on many heights of boxes, with different amounts of resistance.\nWe use a low 12″ box to sit on, just like box squatting. Rock back, swing the arms to the rear while lifting feet off the ground, then swing the arms forward, and slam the feet down as you jump up to the box. The same technique works for the long jump. A different method is to stand in foam and box jump. This is just like jumping out of sand.\nJumping can be very taxing, so first you must build a base:\n– Step one: Placing one foot in front on the floor, and press a barbell overhead for 3-8 reps, whilekeeping your legs straight. This builds every muscle in the body.– Step two: While on your knees, jump onto your feet, the add weight to your back– Step three: Place the bar on your back and power clean to your feet– Step four: Place bar on your thighs and powersnatch to your feet– Step five: Split snatch to your feet\nTry records whenever possible!\n*OCR has jumped onto feet with 265 and jumped off knees onto a 32″ box!Now that you have built your base, you are ready to set your own records. By doing 5 sets of 5 reps with 70lb dumbbells, John Stafford could jump up and touch 11’6” at 6′ tall. And yes- john also has an 832lb deadlift. Lee Henny at 460″ but with a 160lb weight vest, jumped onto a 20″ box. Yurik Vardanyan, a 181-lb Soviet weightlifting champion, could perform a vertical jump measured from the ground to the bottom of his feet with 50% of his but 24′ by combining absolute and explosive strength. Yurick also had a 3.7m standing long jump, a 3-step 2.15m high jump, and a 10.60 100-m time.\nYour lifts and jumps will go up.\nThe last part, or should I say, parts- are sled pulling, and a strongman wheel barrow. Off the heel sled pulling builds all of the muscles that squat and pull, without the constant pounding of the spinal cord. For power sports, 60-yards a trip is a good distance. The wheel barrow will build every muscle from the calf to the traps, and as an extra- builds a great grip.You must build incredible hips, hamstrings, and glutes. So to finish off, head to the reverse hyper, inverse curl machine, and go walk on a Westside Barbell belt squat machine. Plus, to help knee health and help to thicken the soft tissue around the knee, do 100-200 leg curls daily with just 10-20lb ankle weights.By raising your general physical preparedness (G.P.P.), you will be able to train at a higher intensity, more often. The greater the athlete you become, the more special exercises you must introduce into your training. Your GPP will pay great dividends to your specific physical preparation (S.P.P.).\nGood LuckLouie Westside Rules",

Combine these with a balance of strengths… and you’re ready.\nWestside has over 70-800lb squatters, 19 over 1000lbs, 6 over 1100lbs, and 2-1200lb squatters. It’s easy when you know how. What is Perfect Technique? First, place the bar high on your back, sitting on the mid traps. Grab the bar, wrapping your thumbs around it, while positioning your feet at least shoulder width apart. If you are flexible, it’s preferred to keep the feet wider, and pointed out slightly. Arch the back and hold air in your abdomen. To lift the bar out, arch your back and push your feet apart while clearing the rack.As you push out on your feet, force your knees apart. Keep your chest high by continuing to arch your back, and push your glutes out until you reach parallel. Next, drive your upper back into the bar. Never push through your feet first to come back up- this causes one to bend at the waist, and good morning the bar up as a result. Continue to arch your back and push outward on your feet. Box squatting technique is exactly the same, with the exception of releasing the hip muscles while sitting on the box during the concentric phase. Periodization Squatting requires two training days a week, with 72 hours apart for recovery. Day one is the Dynamic Method; for Westsiders this is Friday where you speed squat at 50%-60% of your 1 rep max in a three-week wave.Here are two sample workouts for a 600lb squatter: To View Get your squat manual today Your variants will appear here Get Now! For speed-strength, add 25% band tension at the top for accommodating resistance; this helps to eliminate bar deceleration. After a three-week wave, add band tension or weight by adding chain to the bar. One should change bars regularly if possible, or change the width of the stance. One could even change bar placement from a front to a high bar squat, for those who can overhead squat. Max Effort Day Seventy-two hours later, Westside will max out on a special squat, rack pull, or pull standing on a 2″ or 4′ box. You can switch from sumo to conventional style, but pick one type of squat or pull to max on. What does max out mean? Work up to a max all-time single repetition. On this day, good mornings can also be done in any style- arched back, bent over, wide stance, or close stance. Always switch your max effort exercise each week, but max out with as much as possible on that day. The Max Effort Method is best for raising your personal records for training or a contest.\nOn both days, special exercises must be done for low back, hamstrings, glutes, hips, upper back, and of course- abs. Westside likes a lot of rowing exercises, whether it’s with a bar, dumbbells, or plates by way of both upright rows and shrugs for the upper back. Reverse hypers, back raises, and/or light good mornings for high reps will follow the upper back. Glute-ham raises (GHR) for high reps, leg curls with bands or ankle weights, or inverse curls would be next for hamstrings.You must recover in between workouts. Since one training day is high volume and moderate intensity with very quick muscle contraction and the max effort day can be stressful on your central nervous system (CNS), your GPP must be high. General Physical Preparedness (GPP) Westside uses a lot of sled dragging and pushing of the strong man wheel barrow to increase their level of conditioning. They also do very high reps (up to 100) with light weights on tricep pushdowns, leg curls, shrugs, calf work, and pec work to thicken connective tissue for both increased stored kinetic energy, and injury prevention.\nYou must not lack in any one category, or you will cease to improve, or worse- get injured. This web, if followed correctly, will ensure you have a balanced physique and not overstress any body part.\nIf you put these together, the sky is the limit.

I am referring to my new book Olympic Lifting Strength Manual. My interpretation of building special strengths comes from the former Soviet Union weightlifting coaches. In the book Managing The Training Of Weightlifters it states that as a weightlifter becomes highly qualified they must use at least 50% of the load by special exercises such as squats, pulls, good mornings and a LARGE amount of back extensions and inverse curls.\nWhy?\nTraining loads must grow but if too many classical lifts area done form breaks down, which can not happen. Please pay close attention to A.S. Prilipins loading research in 1974. Use the optimal amount of lifts like what is presented in our book. Also according to A.D Ermakov and N.S Atanasovs data 50% of the volume in the classical lifts must be with 75-85% range.\nJust like I talk about.\nThis data was based off 780 highly skilled weightlifters. This extensive research was good for the GREATEST weightlifters from the Soviet Union. It just so happened to work for my Powerlifting Team breaking over 100 All Time Worlds Records throughout the last 4 decades in different organizations. It also works for all major sports such as baseball world champions, NFL world champions, top rugby teams, so why would it not work for the sport it was meant for?\nWhen forms breaks down in special exercises it has no negative effects on the classical lifts. This is why the chart must be used for all lifts. The Chinese train the squat work load the same as Westside Barbell. The average weight is 80% for about 25 lifts per workout. I think it is fair to say that there team is doing pretty well.\nSo is this a common system?\nYES. This is how a weightlifter must train. This is the Conjugate System by doing many special exercises as it helps perfect form by raising a weak body part. It is referred to in the book, The Fundamentals Of Special Strength Training by Y.V Verkhoshansky.\nThis reflects the Dynamo Club in 1972 where 70 high skilled athletes did an experiment where 20 to 45 special weight lifting exercises were done. After the training ONE lifter was satisfied and the rest wanted more exercises. This was also done by Y.V Verkhoshansky and Medvedev. Medvedev also lists 100 weight lifting exercises in Supertraining by Mel Siff.\nSo why did they not just list a few exercises?\nBecause only a few may be the wrong ones for a lifter. You see after experimenting with a large number of exercises a lifter will find a group of special exercises that work for him or her. If I am wrong SO ARE these men and coach Fang from China. My programming chapter is 50 pages long and calls for roughly 18 snatches of some type and 18 cleans of some type once a week for form work and to build speed strength. 72 hours later a max effort must happen. If you try a max in only the 2 classical lifts you will stop making progress very fast. This means you must execute special exercises to max out on for most of the training cycle.\nFor speed strength the weight used ranges from 75% to 85% as shown in Managing The Training Of The Weightlifter. For maximum effort, unlike the high volume on speed strength day, the volume is very low but intensity is high. Westside breaks some kind of record over 90% of the time. This CAN work for a weightlifter as well.\nWhen a weightlifter comes to Westside Barbell many times in the 45 minutes training session I can have them break there clean record by using a contrast method. Only to have the lifter unable to recover from the clean due to a weak front squat.\nNext Mr Coffee states how I say to raise your squat by not squatting.\nI don’t know what Mr Coffee knows about squatting but Westside has the two top coefficient squats of all time (1180lbs at 264lbs bodyweight by Chuck Vogelpohl and 1210lbs at 271lbs bodyweight by Dave Hoff PLUS Laura Phelps who squatted 715lbs at a body weight of 165lbs) they all box squat for all their training until meet time. Also our top 5 deadlift AVERAGE is 890lbs and top 10 AVERAGE is 866lbs and we never perform a meet style deadlift in training as we save that for the MEET. All this was and is achieved by using this system.\nOh by the way John’s guys don’t squat. Hamstrings, gluteus and hips in addition to a strong back does most of the work. This is why Fang states to lean forward somewhat while executing a front squat. He is of course right.\nIt was good to hear Bob Peoples name and his compassion to the great Isaac Berger. Both men specialized in one lift. Was Bob that bad at cleans or was Isaac that bad deadlifting. They were both smart to do the lift they were bad at to help there specialty.\nWhen Ed and John are not busy writing half the time they should take the time to read a book or watch the Russian and Chinese performing snatch grip deadlifts on the internet. Then let’s look at accommodation. Westside does everything to avoid accommodation by changing many special bars, exercises, to rotating high volume with moderate intensity following a 72 hour recovery window after low volume and 100% intensity with up to six extra workouts a week for single muscle groups.\nWestside recommends 100 to 200 leg curls a day. 80% of our training is on specialty exercises. Note only a model weightlifting can use just a few exercises and must have access to restoration methods i.e. The Bulgarian System. Here is the main problem with most weightlifting coaches. The last sentence about accommodation states you must be creative, you are NOT this. Not even in selecting young weightlifters at 10 years old which is suggested by weightlifting experts.\nHere is where your talent pool comes from. Not every boy or girl wants to be on a team. Many are too short to play ball sports at high level. So why don’t you learn from other countries like Westside Barbell did 34 years ago. When you talk about a “LOW” talent pool you are putting down ALL weightlifters. The drug talk is not called for. There are too many Olympic sports in USA that excel so why not weightlifting?\nPowerlifting have the very same men and women to choose from yet we dominate the world of Powerlifting. The USA holds 9 out of 10 records for women and 7 out of 12 for men. Westside has held 5 out of the 10 women total records and 2 out of the 12 for the men. Westside Barbell has the greatest male and female powerlifters of all time by coefficient.\nTo repeat the system Westside Barbell uses is from track and field and Olympic Weightlifting from mostly the former Soviet Union. It will work for the sport it was intended for, Olympic Weightlifting.\nPlease ALL LIFTERS read ALL the Russian training manuals used at Westside which are translated by Bud Charigr and learn the truth for yourself.\nFind some good training partners and dump a coach that has his head in the sand,\nLouie",

Several special exercises are recommended to increase the correct execution of the “thrust” phase of the jerk. The first is to set up a barbell at a fixed position (height) on pins in a power rack. This will allow the bar to be flexed from the beginning, eliminating the advantageous oscillation that can be gained from the barbell. The exercise is then executed as the athlete starts in a lower position than the lowest position of the dip (fixing the barbell against the clavicles and shoulders). This increases the working effect of the legs and reconstitutes the importance of the “thrust” of the motor apparatus. The athlete then jerks the barbell with maximal force using the legs to elevate the bar to maximal height and extends the arms. This exercise should be worked to a 1rm to provide adequate stress to this phase of the jerk. It is also suitable to perform 18 to 24 lifts at 80 percent with roughly 30 seconds to 60 seconds of rest. This exercise is to be considered as a modification and/or cousin to the deep-paused split jerk. Both exercises require the sportsmen to have perfect positioning to execute the exercise to maximal loads, but more importantly, they train the “thrust” phase of the jerk. Insufficient use of the legs leads to 21 percent of failed lifts in competition. Additionally, 64.3 percent of failed clean and jerks are from errors in the jerk so clearly this is the most important portion of the lift for likelihood of success. This information can be found in Managing the Training of Weightlifters by N.P. Laputin and V.G. Oleshko. Utilizing the push jerk with a box squat is the next exercise that should be incorporated into training. The athlete should sit back, lowering into a squat to a high box. Upon sitting the athlete relaxes the hips, quickly thrusts the barbell vertically upwards and lands with the hips, knees and ankles flexed. This action will help build the pelvic musculature for greater extension strength. Due to the collision force that absorbs some of the kinetic energy of the sportsman, the box will limit his/her capability to move the load. However, this is how the exercise is so useful to increasing the classical jerk. It will not be possible to use maximal loads as in the classical jerk due to the difficulty of the exercise. This is an exercise meant to make the sportsmen strong after the recovery of the clean. It should be used in the forms of front and behind the neck, plus with narrow and wide grips.\nThe “braking” effect of the jerk is a key phase. The shorter the duration of this phase, the faster the force will reach a maximal magnitude. One must switch from the partial squat to the “thrust” as fast as possible because this will create a greater elastic potential in the muscles and result in a higher working effect. Consequently, the faster the switching from yielding to overcoming, the greater the increase of elastic deformation of the muscles (↑potential energy), which increases the working effect, increasing the magnitude of the motive force, which ultimately increases the height the barbell is thrown or elevated. The question then comes as how to train optimally for these components. Two means should be utilized. One includes the increase of explosive strength through jumping or bounding exercises. This will train the amortization phase which will speed the braking effect. This neural mechanism is improved by the myotatic reflex and Golgi tendon reflex. This information can be found in Vladimir Zatsiorsky’s book Science and Practice of Strength Training. Exercise selection should include seated box jumps, triple jumps, jumping with barbells on the back and drop jumps although caution should be used with this exercise. An exercise that is used by many sportsmen is to place a barbell on the back and stand in a narrow stance between two boxes. The athlete then jumps landing into a wider stance on the boxes. The exercise should be performed with various heights and resistive loads. The second way to train optimally is to do extremely large resistive loads in the jerk drive and/or holdings. The athlete must take a barbell from either a power rack or squat rack and perform a controlled lowering and a quick reversal upwards (mimicking the jerk mechanics with exclusion of the squat under). These are typically done for four to six repetitions in the range of 240 kg to 320 kg. Holdings are simply elevating a barbell to a lockout position with the barbell on the clavicles (front rack position). These should be done for a maximal weight since the range of motion is so small. The barbell is only elevated one to three inches typically, but done to the heaviest loads possible. The athlete is to strain for four to 10 seconds and requires immense force to execute. It has been used with 400 kg in China by 77 kg weightlifters. This should give some indication of how strenuous the exercise is. The execution of such will overstimulate the central nervous system and create a pseudo-lightened sensation for weights that are trained in the jerk.\nBand presses in the overhead fashion should be implemented to increase the extensor strength of the arms. They should be used in multiple means such as classical, behind the neck, wide grip, close grip, push press, sots press, split press, Bradford press and incline press. The extensors should then be trained with a plethora of exercises such as weighted dips, push downs, rollback extensions, deficit handstand pushups, weighted pushups, overhead extensions with a plate or barbell with varied resistance. The resistance however must always be stimulating to provide a magnitude of training load that is greater than the neutral level to have continued adaptation. Failure to do so will stagnate the progression of the sportsmen and a detraining effect may occur. Christopher Marang, Exercise Scientist",

It is a sample of a 3 week pendulum wave for the squat, snatch and clean & jerk. This program is one that Westside performs each and every week. It uses the guidelines laid out by A.S. Medvedyev in his book “A System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting”. As well the data of A.S. Prilepin as it appears in the “Managing the Training of Weightlifters”. Prilepin was the Russian national coach for the Junior team from 1975-80 and Senior coach from 1980-85.\nOur wave periodization came from A.D. Ermakov found in “Supertraining”. A.D. Ermakov’s research in “Managing the Training of Weightlifters” of 780 highly skilled weightlifters showed that 50% of their training was between 75 and 85%. Westside used their data to provide the correct amount of volume in the most advantageous intensity zones. This programming allowed lifters at Westside to break over 100 all time world records. Anyone and everyone should be able to follow this program year in year out. The reason is the program is designed off of your maximum not someone else’s.\nWeightlifters have to raise not only the snatch and clean & jerk, but also the squat. First I will layout the squat program for speed strength. Later a 3 week wave for the snatch and clean & jerk. Then 3 or 4 special exercises for the back and leg muscles. We recommend 4 large workouts a week with 2 for speed strength and 2 for max effort.\nThe squat wave (use a box):\n500 Squat Max Week\nPercent\nWeight\nSets\nReps\nLifts\nTotal Volume 1\n75\n375\n12\n2\n24\n9,000 2\n80\n400\n12\n2\n24\n9,600 3\n85\n425\n10\n2\n20\n8,500 (Squat on a box 2 to 3” Below Parallel, On week 4 start front squat)\n400 Front Squat Max Week\nPercent\nWeight\nSets\nReps\nLifts\nTotal Volume 1\n75\n300\n12\n2\n24\n7,200 2\n80\n320\n12\n2\n24\n7,680 3\n85\n340\n10\n2\n24\n6,800 (Squat to a box) The Olympic lifts wave:\n350 Clean & Jerk Max Week\nPercent\nWeight\nSets\nReps\nLifts\nTotal Volume 1\n75\n265\n6\n3\n18\n4,770 2\n80\n280\n6\n3\n18\n5,040 3\n85\n300\n5\n3\n15\n4,500 (This should be used for multiple variations such as below knee, above knee, power, deficit, split) 300 Snatch Max Week\nPercent\nWeight\nSets\nReps\nLifts\nTotal Volume 1\n75\n225\n6\n3\n18\n4,050 2\n80\n240\n6\n3\n18\n4,320 3\n85\n255\n5\n3\n15\n3,825 (This should be used for multiple variations such as below knee, above knee, power, deficit, split) One can implement the overhead squat with the same percentages provided above. Immediately after the squats you must perform 15-18 cleans of some type in power, hang or classical style. Then after a short warmup do 15-18 snatches of some type in power, hang or classical. Accordingly by Prilepin’s charts 15 lifts at 70% range is slightly below the optimal and 15 lifts at 80%is exactly the optimal amount of lifts. This is for a qualified weightlifter.\nThe data by A.D. Ermakov and N.S. Atanasov showed 85% weights are done most. 22.9% in the snatch and 18.4% for the clean. On the contrary 70% weights are used by top weightlifters 11.7% for the snatch and only 8.18% for the clean & jerk. You must use the correct percentages to increase your total. 50% of the training was between 75 and 85%. This is how the Russians trained and of course Westside for the past 34 years.\nFor one to excel at weightlifting the volume must constantly raise year after year, along with the average intensity, meaning a percent of a one repetition maximal. There are many things to consider like gaining weight. Naim Suleymanoglu made constant improvements in the total as he gained bodyweight. At 52kg in 1982 he made 250kg. At 56kg in 1983 he made 290kg. At 60kg from 1984-88 he improved to 342.2kg.\nAccording to the data of Ermakov and Atanasov more than 50% of training came from special exercises. The most common weights for pulls was 95-100%, and A.S. Medvedyev said that strength is the key to progress. If you look at the training of Naim in 1980, in a weekly plan, 147 lifts were special exercises and 105 were classical. This information was taken from Naim Suleymanoglu, The Pocket Hercules.\nAfter the speed strength exercises select an average of 3 special exercises. Good mornings with legs straight and back arched or rounded, next back raises and then calf ham glute raises as an example. While the program requires little special equipment it is advisable to use specialized equipment like te Russians did. This would be belt squats, plyo swing and inverse curls. These make a great difference.\nDrugs is always an issue, what do drugs do? They make it possible to recover from heavy weight training for one thing. So if you do not take drugs you must find a superior method of weight training and this is what I am trying to provide. Let’s look at Max Effort day.\nMaximal Effort method is simply stated as overcoming the largest external resistance one is capable of. This elicits a strong and potent neurological and physiological effect on the body that contributes the greatest improvements in absolute strength. That is why it is superior to all other training methods. It is necessary to be utilizing this method frequently in the training system, and with a vast array of variability. Weightlifters must expose their weak points using this method and rebuild the weakest components of the competitive lifts; i.e. clean and jerk and snatch. The intent is to provide larger strength reserves to increase the likelihood of success, and reductions in total anaerobic fatigue in a competitive setting. Practice of the method is not to have the intent of technical proficiency (which is worked separately), but rather the largest physiological/neurological response to an external load or movement which results in the system’s enhancement.\nThe movements are complex and have various factors affecting the success of the competitive execution of strenuous weights. The clean is composed of a pull and a squat. Therefore, it is easily comprehendible to evaluate where one is lagging in the movement, from a strength perspective. If the sportsmen are only capable of a 400 front squat and have the desire to clean 440 it is essential to build the squat drastically. Logically there is a far greater chance of an athlete who can front squat 500 to clean 440 than the lesser sportsmen who can only stand up with 400. The same goes for the pull. Weightlifting is a pulling sport. The necessity to possess immense levels in strength for all forms of pulling movements from clean grip deadlifts, rack pulls, deficit deadlifts, straight leg, sumo deadlifts, and round back deadlifts finishing with an arched back are fundamentally needed for massive competitive weights to be raised. Viewing several model sportsmen it is seen that all can easily deadlift 440 and most can achieve loads greater than 660 to low 700s for the strongest. Being as we are aiming for the international improvement of the country as a whole, and no longer focused on intra-national performance these are the levels of strength in these exercises we must be viewing as foundational.\nThe snatch is a complex movement, but just as the previous is quite dependent on peculiarities of absolute strength (assuming one can execute the movement efficiently). The snatch is composed of a wide grip deadlift, a high pull, and an overhead squat. Two of the three strength factors rely heavily on the strength of the upper back musculature. Exercises to maximize the building of absolute strength for these areas include (from behind the neck) snatch grip press, narrow grip press, snatch push press, snatch push press to overhead squat, narrow grip overhead squat, overhead squat to a box, dead-stop overhead squats out of a power rack, high pulls to various heights (allowing the barbell to hit a dowel at a predetermined height), snatch support, bench pressing (especially incline) and seated press. The pulling component can be strengthened with the use any of the previous exercises used for the clean pull, however incorporate a wide grip. Deficit deadlifts with the wide grip using a low hip or straight leg position work incredibly well for building the leg strength for the initial phases of the lift. Due to postural nature of the snatch it is needed to have high levels of spinal stabilizational strength in the low back and abdominals when the barbell is at the knees. Many straight leg, with the torso over the barbell, pulls to maximal weights will improve this area of the competitive lift.\nThe jerk is highly dependent on the thrust phase of the lift. This is the moment where the athlete has switched instantaneously from yielding (eccentric component) to the entirety of the overcoming “thrust” phase, pushing the barbell to a maximal height with the legs. This is determined by the work of the lower extremity, similar to the “explosion” mechanism in the snatch and clean. This work is only improved when the maximal strength of the squat is improved. Therefore, the jerk can be increased by several means including box squatting, dead-stop pin squats, pause jerks (in a position lower than the bottom position of the dip to increase the working effect of the lower extremities), dead-stop pin jerks and high box squat push jerks.\nThe classical exercises must be tested as well, but it is essential to have numerous special snatches, cleans and jerks as well for maximal effort execution. Snatch exercises include the classical snatch, classical snatch with straight leg + torso leaned over, classical snatch from deficit, power snatch from a high box position, power snatch with legs straight, narrow grip classical snatch, muscle snatch from deficit and split snatch. All of the previous can be used with two forms of training means; straight bar weight and the second with bar weight and bands. Clean exercises include classical clean, classical clean with barbell above the knees, straight leg muscle clean, power clean from high boxes or power rack, power clean from below the knee, split clean and slow pull classical clean. All of the previous can be used with two forms of training means; straight bar weight and the second bar weight and bands. To stress the understanding of the exercises listed, they will provide the largest increases in the absolute strength of the clean and snatch when trained to a 1 repetition max using the maximal effort method. This exercise list is brief, including the squatting plus pulling movements, and one must continuously create new exercises to change the external stimulus or read literature that has already provided the exercises that have been shown to work best.\nContinuing the application of this method it should be stated that one can also apply maximal effort method to the small exercises as well. It can be used on 100s of rowing exercises (machines or barbells), belt squatting applications, sled pulls, wheelbarrow carries, back raises, inverse curls, hyperextensions and isometrics. Working all small exercises to their “limit strength” (which is the maximal load and stimulation a sportsman can provide in the small exercise) will help increase the absolute strength of the smaller musculature, along with postural strength, aiding in an improvement in technical mastery.\nTable 1. is an example of several real maximal effort workouts with the inclusion of the small assistance exercises that have been applied:\nTable 1.

Pick many, up to 20, special exercises then choose 4 to 8 that work best for you. Everyone does not respond to the same exercises the same way. This is why the lifter must help in choosing the most beneficial ones.\nMedvedyev made 100 workouts for a weightlifter. Provided below is a list from him to choose from. Only 2 are the classic snatch and clean & jerk. These two lifts should be used only at contest or 21 days out from a meet.\nPulling snatch exercises: Power snatch, pull starts at knee.\nPower snatch, leg straight, torso leaning over.\nSnatch pull followed by classic snatch.\nSnatch starting with bar above knee.\nSnatch starting with bar at knee.\nPower snatch followed by overhead squat.\nSnatch pull up to knee.\nSnatch pull up to predetermined pin height. Clean & Jerk exercises: Power clean from floor.\nClean & jerk starting with bar at knee.\nClean pull slow first with a fast second pull.\nClean pull to knee, followed by full clean.\nClean pull, followed by full clean.\nPower clean, squat, jerk.\nClean pull until legs are straight.\nClean pull standing on box. Jerk exercises: Jerk from behind head.\nPush jerk after power clean.\nJerk from rack.\nFront squat followed by jerk.\nSquat, followed by jerk behind head.\nPower clean, push jerk, overhead squat.\nPower clean, squat, jerk.\nPower clean wide grip, followed by wide grip jerk. (sample of Medvedyev special exercises for classical lifts)\nSquat maxes must be done in front and back style on many boxes. 18 to 8” will give many different special squat maxes. One can also do concentric squats, off pins from a power rack, from a very low to ¼ squat. This was used by the Polish Olympic team and can be seen in their films. Here you must use perfect form. Overhead squats can also be used in a similar fashion, using wide grips or clean grips from a low position. All of this will help avoid accommodation and help weightlifting.",

I have seen a lot in 50 years as powerlifting has introduced me to all of my friends as well as most good and bad memories. Looking back, I have seen all the best lifters of the past 50 years. Most will remember the latest and greatest like Hoff, Frankel, Conan and Bridges. While they were undoubtedly unbeatable, they were untested for the most part. But there is one man that comes to mind that was contested by the fact he could be beaten on a bad day if someone else had a great day.\nI met him in my first power meet in the summer of 1966 just prior to being drafted into the United States Army 50 years ago. In that meet there were four men who would become IPF World Champs: Milt McKenzie, George Crawford, Vince Anello and, last but not least, Larry Pacifico, the subject of this article. After getting out of the Army I started to compete in and around Ohio. Larry was the one getting all of the attention setting American records before World records were official. His form was a model of perfection, but his physical strength was amazing in the squat and bench.He[MCJ1] was doing the Bridges Flair before Mike was doing it. He was a tremendous bencher. And there were no bench shirts until 1984, so his bench was raw as they say nowadays. Oh yeah, no squat suit until about 1976, and no disrespect, but the squat suits were not much. They were called Spanjam. There was a two-hour weigh-in and no round system. Yes, a 198 weighed 198 not 225 at meet time with todays 24-hour weigh-ins.I recall weighing less after a meet back in those days. I would ask Larry how to push up my bench and Larry would say to train my triceps because they are 75 percent of your bench. I would hear it from him every meet when he told me if I did not get a better bench I would never win at nationals. He was right.After 10 years‑‑from 1970 to 1980‑‑I won my first nationals with my first top-ten bench. He was right. He also would tell others if they wanted to get a bigger bench gain weight. Yeah he was right. Well most know he won nine straight before making a tactical error when he jumped five pounds on his second attempt on the deadlift, which nullified a third attempt, letting Mark Dimiduk win the1980s nationals and worlds.Larry told me if I would open lighter I would do better, and he was right again.I remember Larry making a 530-pound bench press and a 1,900 total in 1972 in Cincinnati, Ohio, at a body weight of 198. And in Daytona, Ohio, eight weeks later he made a 590-pound bench press at 228 bodyweight. There was no 220 class yet. This was one of the most amazing feats of strength I had ever seen at that time. But while he was doing amazing feats of strength, Larry also was always making a judge, Jerom Weiss, mad. One time while weighing in Larry was standing on one foot just to bug him. We know Larry was one of the greatest lifters of all time, but not much is known about many. Things like how they trained in the beginning.\nI started training at Bob Matz’s gym in Toledo, Ohio, with George Crawford and Milt McKenzie, but won world titles along with Larry.Larry would drive from Dayton to Toledo for four years using a simple 5-3-1 system. I envied Larry for having such good training partners and a coach like Bob Matz. Bob Matz would judge meets and was down right scary to look at. No one ever say a word to him no matter what.The Conversation\nLou: I recall soon after getting home from the army in 1970 you set a national total record on the same day as Joe Weinstein at 1675 at 198. Larry: Yes. We had a rivalry in the early 70s.Lou: Before we get into your powerlifting life, did you ever play other sports? Larry: Yes. I was a gymnast in New York where I grew up. I also was a shotput and discus thrower and won Athlete of the Year in New York in 1964. I weighed 150 pounds back then.Lou: When you moved to Dayton what was your occupation? And tell me something about your personal life.Larry: I was vice president of Holiday and New Life Spas, there were 20 of us all total. I have three kids: Jimmy who works with me at Pacifico Power, Pat who lives in Coco Beach, and daughter Theresa Nelson. I was married three times.Lou: How many world records did you break in your illustrious career?Larry: 54Lou: I know you had rivals along the way. I also know you were never cocky or arrogant, but totally confident and fun when I was around you. At meets a certain aura surrounded you.Larry: My first rival was Joe Weinstein. Then Ronnie Ray from Texas and a guy they called Mel Hennessey of Minnesota. He trained with Don Cundy the first to make an 800 deadlift, and Jerry Gones who would wear a superhero suit at a meet and a wig. They called Mel the king of the bench press. When we competed against each other I won 575 to 505.\nLou: Was there somebody you loved to beat?Larry: Yes. Ed Baueuscroft of California. I guess he got too much publicity and I wanted to crush him. That’s what makes powerlifting such a great sport. There was no money meets back then.Lou: What motivated you back then?Larry: A strong desire to be the best and win all the time at anything. Lou: There were other super stars from England. Ron Collins who would mostly lift at 181 and you were mostly a 198 and there was a lot of talk of a match between you.Larry: Yes, it would be at 198, but never happened.Lou: You won nine worlds starting in 1971, it ended at Wisconsin in 1980. What really happened that day that allowed Mark Dimiduk to win the 1980 SR nationals and that would select the 1980 world team members.Larry: On a second attempt deadlift I wanted a 5 kg jump. I must have said 5 pounds which was a 2.5kg jump[MCJ2] . The rule said small jump of 2.5 kg would nullify a third and that is how I lost the bid for my 10th world championship.Lou: Tell us about your most memorable world championship.Larry: That would be my first in 1971 against John Kanter. I won on bodyweight after John missed a third deadlift. Both of us totaled 1,815.\nLou: What happened when you lifted against Paul Jordan of Austraila?Larry: Paul was talking about winning the world against my friend and fellow Ohioian Vince Annelo the greatest deadlifter. So as we got off the plane Paul was waiting for us to step off the plane. When he first saw Vince he could tell he had dropped down to 198, then he saw me all bulked up and ready for battle. I could not believe it Paul was calling my room and even trying to send girls to my room. In the meet Paul tore a quad and broke an ankle. And I won the worlds. It seems that Jordan’s powerlifting was gone, but good fortune would be his as he began to train horses and became Australia’s top horse trainer.Lou: You know all the greats and beat them all: Marv, Phillips, Roger Estep … the list is too long. And then one day it was over.Larry: Yes I have had 16 surgeries from powerlifting including one freak accident when I almost cut my fingers off when I dropped a bar on myself.Lou: I know you were one of the first to sell power knee wraps and suits.Larry: Yes. I came up with a wrestling singlet with legs, but somehow George Langas took the idea and sold them under the name Spanjam, which I distributed.Lou: You had a lot of lifters come stay with you such as Mike Bridges who you said was the strongest man under 200 pounds. And Don Reinhoudt the SHW world champ. And your team Power Elite with your lifters including Topsogov Studer.Larry: We had a great team back then and I will always look back to the early days without so much politics.\nLou: I want to thank you for doing this interview and for the memories you have left imprinted on powerlifting and after knowing you for the last fifty years, on me. Thanks.Louie Simmons.",

He was just a kid and Kenny Ried sent him over to watch us train. I could tell he was an intense kid to say the least as he could not standstill. Soon after I made the mistake of opening a commercial gym, but it was a good mistake as many of our current private gym members are still at Westside: Jimmy Ritchie, Joe, and Mike Jester along with Mark Marnelli, Gino Cardy, Dominic Rotolo.\nMark owns Strong Style MMA in Cleveland and Geno is an oil engineer. Dominic Rotolo owns a great chain of restaurants in Columbus Ohio and Kenny Patterson one of our strongest and greatest benchers. But back to Chuck.Chuck started to train with Mark, Matt Dimmel and myself. I could tell he had unlimited potential as a lifter. I had just started to train the Soviet’s way two years before so Chuck was starting outright. He was both very strong and very powerful. He was thin at that time, about 180 pounds but started to gain weight fast. After two years it was off to Toledo Ohio for his first real meet and my attempt to get my fifth elite total, this time at 275lbs. I made the total and I saw Chuck was the real deal. He had it all, but would he use it?\nWell, in 1987 Chuck was at the YMCA nationals. I told Chuck that everyone is strong at this level, but of course, he was late for the warm-ups and took only one weight – 465lbs. His opener was 683, he blew it up and won the national title. Nothing seemed to upset him. I could tell that the deadlift was going to be his top lift, but things would change. He was getting stronger and stronger in all three lifts.Mark Martinelli and everyone that trained with our group we liked to play around the gym, it as always boxing or wrestling. I told Chuck not to wrestle with Matt Dimmel. Matt was real big and a lot faster than you could imagine, he almost killed me on more than one occasion. That did not stop Chuck from trying though, Matt got Chuck in a guillotine choke and broke his neck. This is not an exaggeration.Well, Chuck’s bench went from 480 pounds to 135 pounds overnight. I told him to go to a doctor to find out for sure what was wrong. It only took him a year to go, but it was confirmed the neck was broken. It finally caused Chuck to get an operation, but that did not stop him. He saw me break my patellar tendon in half. Chuck then picked me up after the doctors tried to kill me in surgery and five days later made me max out in the bench with a hole in my throat and stitches in my side from chest tubes.\nThis is why he is such a good motivator.Then recovering I wanted to box squat 500 pounds, which I eventually did causing me to hurt my other hip. Chuck was already loading 525 on the bar and you can’t say no to Chuck… I made the 525lbs. It took me two months to recover and when I came back I wanted to do 550 and the same thing happened again. Before I could say anything Chuck was putting 575 on the bar. There was no way but to do it.\nLooking back Chuck must have got a lot of pussy because nobody could say no to Chuck, haha.\nNext in our evolution of training was using chains. Dave Tate and Chuck jumped right in and made good progress along with heavy sled pulling, next came rubber bands. What this brought about was amazing. In many ways the gym was strong as hell. At the ’95 and ’96 WPC worlds, where they score the top six lifters, Westside won both worlds with four-first and two-seconds each. Chuck took some time off from training for meets but was working on heavy band squats and just trying out a canvas suit. It was the year 2000 and his best squat was 865. Dave Tate was putting on the IPA nationals and Chuck opened at 900 pounds 35 over his best. I recall Dave saying: “Is he crazy?” I replied “what do you think?”. Well, he could not get to depth with 900lbs and went up to 950lbs. Again it was high, so now Chuck states give me 1000lbs. This was over the World Record and would make him the lightest to do a grand. He smoked it for a world record. What made it more impressive was he was in 2 car wrecks that week. One month later he squatted 1025lbs in West Virginia at Mike Hill's meet. Chuck was getting huge but kept trying to make 220lbs and this hurt his squat. After winning the light and heavyweights at the WPO which I think he was the only one to do that. He bombed due to no strength in his legs from cutting too much weight. I told him to go up a weight class as he was cutting from 255lbs to 220lbs.6 weeks later lifting in Janesville at 264lbs he made a 1150lbs world record. He made it look like 135lbs. He had done two box squats with 835lbs and 885lbs bar weight plus 640lbs in band tension. This I saw but still cannot believe to this day. He may be the greatest geared squatter ever and still holds the world record with 1140lbs at 242lbs. Only Dave Hoff of Westside made a better coefficient squat.I like to think that I taught Chuck a lot but in fact he taught me more about training than I ever did him. Chuck and I would train for 30 to 45 minutes before anyone else would show up. Being 18 years older I never let him do any training without me doing something. Chuck would do 1000 sit-ups a day and lots of pulldowns. I asked him what pulldowns did for him. Chuck said nothing, he just liked to do them.Chuck always had thin legs but gained a lot of size during his training. So I said to him “what made your legs get not only bigger but stronger?”. He told me it had to be the bands. I would always ask even when I knew the answer but wanted to hear it from one of the greats.Chuck would also do 1000lbs rack deadlifts and he said after thinking for a while it taught him how to strain. I thought if anyone knows how to strain its him. Later I thought about what he said and I guess that is how he found out how to strain. Deadlifting with lots of bands on the bar made it very hard and slow, I asked him what this did for him. He said something very important: it taught him how to think while straining. This is very profound but with all his knowledge about training, it was his ability to motivate others that made him an invaluable training partner. Somehow he can make a dead man train harder. He also knew when someone could not cut it at Westside.He would say Lou get his key and kick him out. He was always right. Being strong is very important in any sport. When Chuck was not at a top-level he was almost nice, I said almost. But when he was at his strongest he was nasty and that was the way I liked him the best.To close, there was and still is a lot of Chuck wannabes, wearing hats and looking fierce. Buts all they are, Wannabes.There was, there is, and there will only be one Chuck Vogelpohl.\n- - - Learn More Here!",

I am referring to my new book Olympic Lifting Strength Manual. My interpretation of building special strengths comes from the former Soviet Union weightlifting coaches. In the book Managing The Training Of Weightlifters it states that as a weightlifter becomes highly qualified they must use at least 50% of the load by special exercises such as squats, pulls, good mornings and a LARGE amount of back extensions and inverse curls.\nWhy?\nTraining loads must grow but if too many classical lifts area done form breaks down, which can not happen. Please pay close attention to A.S. Prilipins loading research in 1974. Use the optimal amount of lifts like what is presented in our book. Also according to A.D Ermakov and N.S Atanasovs data 50% of the volume in the classical lifts must be with 75-85% range.\nJust like I talk about.\nThis data was based off 780 highly skilled weightlifters. This extensive research was good for the GREATEST weightlifters from the Soviet Union. It just so happened to work for my Powerlifting Team breaking over 100 All Time Worlds Records throughout the last 4 decades in different organizations. It also works for all major sports such as baseball world champions, NFL world champions, top rugby teams, so why would it not work for the sport it was meant for?\nWhen forms breaks down in special exercises it has no negative effects on the classical lifts. This is why the chart must be used for all lifts. The Chinese train the squat work load the same as Westside Barbell. The average weight is 80% for about 25 lifts per workout. I think it is fair to say that there team is doing pretty well.\nSo is this a common system?\nYES. This is how a weightlifter must train. This is the Conjugate System by doing many special exercises as it helps perfect form by raising a weak body part. It is referred to in the book, The Fundamentals Of Special Strength Training by Y.V Verkhoshansky.\nThis reflects the Dynamo Club in 1972 where 70 high skilled athletes did an experiment where 20 to 45 special weight lifting exercises were done. After the training ONE lifter was satisfied and the rest wanted more exercises. This was also done by Y.V Verkhoshansky and Medvedev. Medvedev also lists 100 weight lifting exercises in Supertraining by Mel Siff.\nSo why did they not just list a few exercises?\nBecause only a few may be the wrong ones for a lifter. You see after experimenting with a large number of exercises a lifter will find a group of special exercises that work for him or her. If I am wrong SO ARE these men and coach Fang from China. My programming chapter is 50 pages long and calls for roughly 18 snatches of some type and 18 cleans of some type once a week for form work and to build speed strength. 72 hours later a max effort must happen. If you try a max in only the 2 classical lifts you will stop making progress very fast. This means you must execute special exercises to max out on for most of the training cycle.\nFor speed strength the weight used ranges from 75% to 85% as shown in Managing The Training Of The Weightlifter. For maximum effort, unlike the high volume on speed strength day, the volume is very low but intensity is high. Westside breaks some kind of record over 90% of the time. This CAN work for a weightlifter as well.\nWhen a weightlifter comes to Westside Barbell many times in the 45 minutes training session I can have them break there clean record by using a contrast method. Only to have the lifter unable to recover from the clean due to a weak front squat.\nNext Mr Coffee states how I say to raise your squat by not squatting.\nI don’t know what Mr Coffee knows about squatting but Westside has the two top coefficient squats of all time (1180lbs at 264lbs bodyweight by Chuck Vogelpohl and 1210lbs at 271lbs bodyweight by Dave Hoff PLUS Laura Phelps who squatted 715lbs at a body weight of 165lbs) they all box squat for all their training until meet time. Also our top 5 deadlift AVERAGE is 890lbs and top 10 AVERAGE is 866lbs and we never perform a meet style deadlift in training as we save that for the MEET. All this was and is achieved by using this system.\nOh by the way John’s guys don’t squat. Hamstrings, gluteus and hips in addition to a strong back does most of the work. This is why Fang states to lean forward somewhat while executing a front squat. He is of course right.\nIt was good to hear Bob Peoples name and his compassion to the great Isaac Berger. Both men specialized in one lift. Was Bob that bad at cleans or was Isaac that bad deadlifting. They were both smart to do the lift they were bad at to help there specialty.\nWhen Ed and John are not busy writing half the time they should take the time to read a book or watch the Russian and Chinese performing snatch grip deadlifts on the internet. Then let’s look at accommodation. Westside does everything to avoid accommodation by changing many special bars, exercises, to rotating high volume with moderate intensity following a 72 hour recovery window after low volume and 100% intensity with up to six extra workouts a week for single muscle groups.\nWestside recommends 100 to 200 leg curls a day. 80% of our training is on specialty exercises. Note only a model weightlifting can use just a few exercises and must have access to restoration methods i.e. The Bulgarian System. Here is the main problem with most weightlifting coaches. The last sentence about accommodation states you must be creative, you are NOT this. Not even in selecting young weightlifters at 10 years old which is suggested by weightlifting experts.\nHere is where your talent pool comes from. Not every boy or girl wants to be on a team. Many are too short to play ball sports at high level. So why don’t you learn from other countries like Westside Barbell did 34 years ago. When you talk about a “LOW” talent pool you are putting down ALL weightlifters. The drug talk is not called for. There are too many Olympic sports in USA that excel so why not weightlifting?\nPowerlifting have the very same men and women to choose from yet we dominate the world of Powerlifting. The USA holds 9 out of 10 records for women and 7 out of 12 for men. Westside has held 5 out of the 10 women total records and 2 out of the 12 for the men. Westside Barbell has the greatest male and female powerlifters of all time by coefficient.\nTo repeat the system Westside Barbell uses is from track and field and Olympic Weightlifting from mostly the former Soviet Union. It will work for the sport it was intended for, Olympic Weightlifting.\nPlease ALL LIFTERS read ALL the Russian training manuals used at Westside which are translated by Bud Charigr and learn the truth for yourself.\nFind some good training partners and dump a coach that has his head in the sand,\nLouie",

I had just deadlifted 670lbs at 180lbs in February of 1973. I also had sciatic nerve damage in both legs that I could not straighten them out without severe pain. After being on crutches for most of ten months with no help from a variety medical experts. I could no longer do any exercises. One day I tried to do a back extension, but I would experience extreme pain in the lower back as soon as I applied force into the toe plate. It was very painful in the glutes and the back of my legs. I was desperate, I could not work, and certainly not powerlift. No one was helping. One day I thought what if I did a back extension in reverse? I built a platform in my power rack so my torso is suspended and supported while my legs were hanging downward (face down). As I held onto the front of the rack I raised my legs upward with no pain. I was also able to lower my legs past 90% again with no pain.\nFor the first time in almost a year I felt blood flow or a pump in my lower back. At the same time, my sciatic pain was lessened. I could not believe it, was it just in my head? The next day I repeated the exercise with the same results. I continued the exercises several times a week and eventually the pain was gone. How? Much later I realized I was using decompression while strengthening all the muscles, ligaments and tendons of the lower back. As my abdomen was suppressed it increased the IAP which lessened the load on the intervertebral discs. I was able to resume lifting and ranked 4th in 1978 and 5th in 1979 in the 198 weight class. In 1980 I made the 3rd largest total of all time at 220lbs. Unfortunately, I broke my L5 again in 1982. A surgeon advised me to remove two discs, fuse my back and remove several bone spurs. I refused. I repaired my back once, why not again? For seventeen weeks I stretched, used acupressure, acupuncture and light reverse hypers for high reps, 20 – 25 per set, 4 sets per day. I once again regained full back strength and rose back into the top five rankings. After complete rupture of the patella tendon I found it hard to do my job as an iron worker. The reverse hyper exercise was a complete secret to myself, as I trained in my private gym. I hired a patent attorney to do a service and in 1994 I was granted my first patent. My motive was helping others with chronic back issues. I later made several improvements in 2004-2007-2009 and 2013 and am now working on a much improved model for Drs., Therapist, and Chiropractors. The reverse hyper will work the muscles of the lumbar region (specifically), the epaxial muscles such as the inner spinals connecting adjacent spacious processes or the intramuscular salis. Connecting adjacent traverse processes of the vertebrae are difficult to activate in most exercises. What’s the answer? The Reverse Hyper™ made it possible to squat 705, bench 505 and deadlift 675 at 63 years old. To prove this I placed the machine in the DMX x-ray thanks to Dr. Jerome Rerucha and can be seen within the above Youtube Video.\nPain Described by Dr. Jerome Rerucha\nOne of the most important considerations in physical training is to first remain injury free or in the event of prior injury, to promote recovery so the individual can maintain training. This is true when working with a novice, a collegiate athlete, a professional competitive athlete, a fitness enthusiasts or even the general public trying to maintain an active lifestyle. Whatever your role: a personal trainer, strength and conditioning coach or clinician, pain and injury is a component that needs to be understood.\nPain is categorized as either acute (generally from a known cause or immediate trauma leading to injury) or chronic (long lasting). There are many subcategories or diagnoses under each of these main categories. We may feel the pain in our toes when we stub them, however the recognition, interpretation, and reaction to the pain occur in the brain; not at the symptomatic area. Awareness of pain happens when sensory neurons (special nerves throughout the body) react to pressure, vibration, trauma, heat, cold, and other stimuli. These neurons also respond to prostaglandins, histamine, and other chemicals released by injured or inflamed body tissue. The level of the sensation depends upon the strength of the stimulus and the total health (or lack thereof) of the body. When sensory neurons are stimulated, the nerves fire sending off messages that travel along the nervous system to the brain, then the pain information is rapidly evaluated, and sensations are interpreted. This complex reaction in the communication systems of the body protects us when there is a stressor (danger is a lil intense);when the protection due to the stress has passed, the brain is told to turn off the feeling of pain. If there is a problem in the communication system of the body; all of the neurological, chemical and emotional communication systems may not be able to tell the pain to stop.\nAcute pain makes you aware of many problems in the body from torn ligaments to gallbladder attacks. At low levels, pain can motivate you to rest the injured area so that tissues can be repaired and additional damage can be prevented. Acute pain lets out a three-alarm warning when you accidentally put your hand on a hot stove or when it forces you to rest a sprained ankle. Frequently, traumatic pain is dealt with properly because the cause of trauma can be accurately identified and eliminated at which time the natural healing of the body can begin. Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation is commonly used effectively. For faster healing cold laser therapy, chiropractic care, acupuncture, Rolfing, soft tissue and other modalities can speed healing significantly and provide long term correction from some of the trauma that was encountered to the nervous system, skeletal system, fascia and muscles. Rehabilitation is very beneficial once the body can handle the excess physical stress of exercise.\nNot all pain serves a useful function. While acute pain can alert us to a problem that needs immediate attention, in some cases pain lasts long after an injured area has healed. In other instances, pain may be in the form of a recurring backache, migraines (or other types of headaches), arthritis, and other disorders. This is referred to as chronic pain. Chronic pain may be a dull ache, sharp, stabbing, radiating, throbbing pain or any combination of these that seem to never subside or it may be experienced during certain times of the day and is lasting for more than six months. Pain may be localized at the site of an injury, or “referred” to another part of the body. Chronic pain may occur after a physical injury or surgery and continues after the normal healing period. Chronic pain can accompany many disease conditions such as fibromyalgia, headaches, neuropathy, depression, PMS, post-surgical pain syndrome, the accumulation of training stresses and many others. Chronic pain is a complex condition with a variety of causes. Remember, pain is only interpreted by the nervous system and identified by the brain. When pain persists, there is a lot of attention placed on the area of symptomatology, in a variety of ways depending on the type of specialist seen. Little effort is directed toward the retraining of lower motor neurons in order to ultimately change upper motor neuron activity in the brain which inhibits the reflex pathways and Type C fibers that have become incorrectly programmed. “Neuroplasticity” is a modern term to describe the remodeling of brain patterning; this includes pain. Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, referring to changes in the neural pathways and synapses which affect changes in behavior, environment and neural processes, as well as the changes resulting from bodily injury. Neuroplasticity has replaced the formerly-held position that the brain is a physiologically static organ, and explores how and in which ways the brain changes throughout life based upon what you do; this can be regenerative or degenerative.\nNeuroplasticity occurs on a variety of levels, ranging from cellular changes due to learning, to large-scale changes involved in cortical remapping in response to injury. The role of neuroplasticity is widely recognized in healthy development, learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage; but I also recognize the correlation with elite fitness; not just clinical pathology. During most of the 20th century, the consensus among neuroscientists was that brain structure is relatively immutable after a critical period during early childhood. This belief has been changed by findings revealing that many aspects of the brain remain plastic even into adulthood. Decades of research have now shown that substantial changes occur in the lowest neocortical processing areas, and that these changes can profoundly alter the pattern of neuronal activation in response to experience. This why you can train your body to be strong, which can only happen after your nervous system is trained to be strong, within those pathways. This also applies to pain and visceral patterns. Neuroscientific research indicates that experience can actually change both the brain’s physical structure (anatomy) and functional organization (physiology). Neuroscientists are currently engaged in a reconciliation of critical period studies demonstrating the immutability of the brain after development with the more recent research showing how the brain can, and does, change throughout life. Later on in this paper a brief explanation of patterning will be described. Many of you who are strong and injury free will say “I already do that” and that is not a coincidence.\nChronic pain is one of the most costly conditions in North America. Although pain is a major problem in this country, it is not treated compassionately or efficiently, and it is not just pain that is the problem. The side effects of chronic pain illnesses caused by a sedentary lifestyle, seclusion and depression and, in some cases, addiction to pain killers can be just as devastating as the pain itself. The estimated costs of direct medical expenses, lost income, lost productivity, compensation payments, and legal charges, are approximately $90 billion a year.\n• 48 million Americans suffer from chronic pain. Over 21 million Americans routinely take prescription painkillers and also spend $3 billion on over the counter analgesics.• Over 13 million Americans cannot perform routine activities because of pain.• As many as 45 million Americans have chronic, severe headaches that can be disabling.• Arthritis pain affects more than 40 million Americans each year.• The majority of patients in intermediate or advanced stages of cancer suffer moderate to severe pain. More than 1.2 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and more than 550,000 people die from the disease.• Fourteen percent of employees take time off from work because of pain.• According to the National Institutes of Health (Harris et al. 1999), lower back pain is one of the most significant health problems in the United States, with back pain being the most frequent cause of physical impairment in people younger than 45 years of age: 65-80% of all people have back pain at some time in their life. Although there are numerous types of injuries caused by countless circumstances, affecting the general public and athletes alike, we will concentrate on the #1 neuro-musculoskeletal injury in the world; back pain. The same principles apply when addressing any “systemic” weakness, asymmetry, inflexibility or improper functional (neurological) movement.\nBack pain is the number one musculoskeletal problem in the world and the second most common reason for all visits to the doctors’ office (#1 reason for the orthopedist). Low back pain primarily effects adults, ages 35-55, but may occur in children and adolescence. Approximately 75 % of people in developed countries will experience low back pain at some time in their lives. The annual prevalence of low back pain in the U.S. is 15%-20% of the population. Back pain is the second leading cause of absenteeism from work, after the common cold, and accounts for 15 % of sick leaves. Back injuries cause 100 million lost days of work annually, and is the most costly for employers. Approximately 1% of the U.S. population is chronically disabled due to back problems and another 1% is temporarily disabled. Signs and symptoms are centralized in the low back area and vary dependent upon the severity of the injury. Acute or chronic back pain symptoms can give indications as to the cause of the pain. Many common symptoms are;\n• Paraspinal muscle spasms• Possible radiation of pain to the buttocks and into the lower extremities (sciatica)• Limited range of motion• Pain aggravated by motion and alleviated by rest• Severe pain leading to change in posture\nRisk Factors-• More common in men than women• Common in those with high labor intensive jobs with a lot of repetitive bending• Obesity• Anatomical short leg (causing pelvic unleveling and spinal torqueing)• Trauma such as fractures, herniated discs, ligament sprain, muscle strain• Non-traumatic causes such as degenerative disc disease, inflammatory arthritis• Osteoporosis• Spondylolisthesis• Facet Syndrome• Sacral misalignments• Lumbar subluxations• Spinal Stenosis• Muscle imbalances• Visceral conditions (female cycle, colon, prostate, kidney, bladder)• Smoking\nThere are many causes of low back pain, from predisposed risk factors to acute injuries. These conditions can be divided into the broad categories of traumatic and non-traumatic.\nTraumatic\n•Micro traumas (jogging on hard surfaces, etc.)•Macro traumas (car accident, impact traumas)•Soft tissue sprain (ligaments), strain (muscular)•Fractures•Subluxations and dislocations•Herniated discs•Overexertion, fatigue (improper lifting)\nNon-traumatic\n•Arthritis•Degenerative disc disease•Side effects from medication (cholesterol lowering drugs)•Sedentary life style•Spinal structural imbalances (poor posture)\nLow back pain can have many variables. Although, many individuals complain of localized symptoms, a successful program takes into account the health of the entire neuro-musculoskeletal-fascial system. Identifying weaknesses are important; however exercise or stretching isolated areas has proven to be ineffective, especially for long term relief. The body works together as a unit. Training the core strength of the body to achieve the ideal neutral posture, proper intersegmental motion, activating the nervous system and muscles synergistically to perform flexible, symmetrical functional movement creates a strong, healthy and pain free structure is the most effective method to reduce the incidence of low back pain (or any other injury) and also for those working for optimum performance.\nResearch has shown that those who suffer from back pain have a common imbalance throughout the musculoskeletal system. A normal spine has an ideal center of gravity from head carriage to the center of gravity over the pelvis. When people have a forward head tilt; for every one inch forward the head is held, there is a 100% increase in the weight of the head.\nA publication in Spine, the most renowned orthopedic medical journal in the world, September 15, 2005; 30 (18): 2024-9 “The impact of positive sagittal balance in adult spinal deformity”, explains this concept accurately. The study used lateral full spine x-rays and measured overall spinal alignment usingreference points from the center of the 7th cervical vertebra and the posterior-superior corner of the 1st sacral segment. A plumb line was then used todetermine center of gravity and measure overall displacement and how thisdirectly related to patients severity of symptoms of pain and overall decreasein health by also using (the standard form), the SF 36.\n• “All measures of health status showed significantly poorer scores as the C7 plumb line deviation increased (forward head carriage / body).”• “There was a high degree of correlation between positive sagittalbalance and adverse health status scores, for physical healthcomposite score and pain domain.”\n• “There was clear evidence of increased pain and decreased function as the magnitude of positive sagittal balance (forward head carriage / body) increased.”\nThis study shows that although even mildly positive sagittal balance is somewhat detrimental, severity of symptoms increases in a linear fashion with progressive sagittal imbalance (forward head carriage) per every 1 mm).”\nIn addition to anterior head carriage the pelvis commonly becomes “tipped” forward (referred to as lower cross syndrome) which creates further abnormal biomechanics and pressure and eventually leads to increased stress to the facets, injuries to the discs, vertebrae, ligaments and muscle imbalances. These mechanical stresses create pain signals throughout the nervous system and lock in a pattern of back pain (or injury to any area due to involvement throughout facial planes.\nPoor daily habits promote an unhealthy lifestyle pattern beginning in childhood and continuing throughout the adult years. The flexor muscles of the body are overworked and the extensor muscles are severely under used. This cycle is created by young children in school sitting for extended periods during the growth and formative years. Children are not as active as in previous generations, relying on television and video games rather than proprioceptive dynamic activities. In early adulthood we are “flexor conditioned”. Many spend long hours sitting in the college classroom or at the desk jobs of corporate America. We have a labor force that performs repetitive bending (flexion) activities for many hours every day and who spend extended periods of time sitting in cars, commuting while doing nothing to offset this imbalanced lifestyle and promote proper health or recovery from injury. The physical imbalances are amplified by chemical imbalances of increased sugar / carbohydrates, energy drinks, supplements loaded with high fructose corn syrup, improper ratios of essential fatty acids (ideal EPA 1.5: AA 1 ratio) all amplifying systemic inflammation; further load the body up with artificial sweeteners (sucralose causes pain and stiffness and aspartame is a documented neurotoxin) and you have a physical and chemical crystal ball for pain, suffering and reoccurring injury.\nMany patients/athletes report their acute injury was caused by a sneeze, or “throwing their back out tying their shoe” or “picking up a pencil off the floor”. Although the injury effects are real and severe, taking a history and proper (functional) examination reveals many precipitating stresses and physical imbalances that led to the weakened condition that created the buckling injury. Even in the case of true acute injuries, such as car accidents and impact trauma, the focus of restoring spine stabilizing patterns to the whole musculoskeletal and nervous system is necessary for full, long term recovery.\nPoor biomechanics and repetitive stress also place an abnormal load on the muscles and the spine that leads to injury. Remember it is the muscles that stabilize and protect the spine and nervous system (all synergistically working together) drives proper communication. The spinal stabilizer muscles require;\n• Endurance to withstand the task of standing for hours and performing labor intensive, daily and athletic duties.• Strength to stabilize the core of the musculoskeletal system.• Flexibility to perform dynamic motion.• Balance to properly displace stress throughout the musculoskeletal system in an ideal weight bearing position• Increase in circulation accelerates tissue regeneration and recovery by bringing in nutrients and taking away metabolic by products.\nA multidimensional evaluation and progressive program is optimum for any individual however, for the purpose of this publication, we will only include some important points.Ideally each individual needs to be evaluated and a specific plan designed depending on asymmetry, injury or injuries involved.\nSolutions; “If it is good for a strong person, it is good for a weak person. You just have to decrease the intensity so it is appropriate for the individual.”\nThe body is designed to move; to perform the normal activities of daily living. Elite athletes require more strength, endurance, balance, flexibility, mitochondrial output of ATP than the average person. Proper structural alignment is required to perform a task successfully and injury free. The average individual can perform normal daily activities with physical functional measurements far below those of the elite athlete. If either individual is physically unprepared (over time), the weakness will create an acute and possibly a chronic injury pattern.\nInitially, in my professional career I was in the strength-coaching field where I gained valuable experience that gave me indispensable insight as I continued my education as a clinician. I have extensive background training both novice and elite athletes in a variety of sports and I became a competitive power lifter for 14 years. Understanding different body types, designing individual and team programs for specific physiological outcomes has helped me, as a clinician, to provide any necessary variable to help competitive athletes or the general public. Every day in practice or as I lecture to other clinicians, I use my extensive background in exercise physiology and the strength field.\nClinicians receive an extensive education in the basic sciences, which enables them to diagnose, within the scope of their license, and to use tools, such as x-ray, MRI, the knowledge to perform ortho/neuro exams etc. and to interpret clinical findings. All clinical exams are neutral exams, out of gravity. Some may want to claim that ortho/neuro tests are functional and that they are beneficial to a person with a physical injury. These exams are completely worthless when evaluating an uninjured individual and therefore cannot provide the benefit of being able to measure progress or to prevent a problem, in the first place, if you cannot detect predispositions to an injury. Once a detailed analysis has been completed, as a clinician, it is your responsibility to “manage” the patient and to design a program for recovery. Some clinicians merely concentrate on and “manage” just the diagnosis, overlooking many possible contributing factors, or minimally, some clinicians just “manage” the symptoms, often times achieving only a temporary solution to the overall condition. The majority of care relies on passive treatment applications; lying on a table to get adjusted, Rolfed, massaged, acupuncture or being hooked up to a variety of electrical stimulation devices, ice, heat, take this medication or a surgery is performed. I could write a book on patient success and the benefits and life changing results from many of these passive modalities that are appropriate and effective for treatment. There is no substitute for proper chiropractic adjustments for injured individuals or athletes training for peak performance with absolutely no injuries. The point to be made is; passive treatment is only as good as the strength of the organism, injured areas have a compromised metabolism at the mitochondrial level. Many patients only want passive care and are unwilling participate in progressive activity for full recovery or better yet be proactive to prevent the predisposition in the first place. I have taught thousands of practitioners, from a variety of health specialties, over the years and the reality is many clinicians have “zero” experience or knowledge of movement let alone the knowledge of safe, effective exercises and stretches and other modalities to help correct the many problems seen by clinicians.\nI compliment practitioners for the great work they currently perform; however a great advancement for the future of any medical care is for clinicians to be aware of the benefits provided by the strength and conditioning industry and to integrate programs into their current services. There is a limit to the success from passive care. Without the knowledge of what can be achieved when integrating these various modalities of treatment, the next step (activation of proper movement) in the progression of treatment will not be achieved.\nStrength and conditioning coaches and personal training have little to no experience in managing clients with a medical diagnosis, however, many are experts in movement and activation and teach proper exercise technique. For clinicians to have knowledge of strength, flexibility training, kettlebells, bodyweight exercises, Olympic lifting etc. would be invaluable in evaluating the injured patient.\nTime and time again for every millimeter of flexibility improvement (to promote symmetry) and every small increment of strength that is gained, there is a linear progression of improvement even in the many individuals with chronic conditions. These positive results are greatly amplified when combining specific adjustments, low level laser therapy, soft tissue work or a wide variety of therapeutic options. When you have had the opportunity to work extensively on both average patients as well as elite athletes, it is amazing how physically incapable people become; being unable to even walk up stairs or get up off the floor unassisted. When entire professions are incapable of identifying improper functional movement and these imbalances and asymmetries are not addressed for a long period of time, they inevitably will manifest into chronic degenerative pathologies; even with common proper passive treatments being performed.\nThere are many beneficial strength exercises and rehabilitation variables; let us focus on the pelvis and the importance that center mass and how it applies whether you are picking up a sack of groceries or you are an all pro offensive lineman; your center strength and function matters; and it effects the entire organism. An example of combining information between my personal and professional strength and conditioning career and clinical career is the use of the Reverse Hyperextension to produce significant physical improvement in those with debilitating conditions as well as use for elite athletic performance. I was first made aware of the Reverse Hyperextension in the early 1990’s. I was already competing at the national level, saw an article written by Louie Simmons in Powerlifting USA; the information made sense, our gym got one and I have used it ever since. Already being a nationally ranked strength athlete, the first workout with the Reverse Hyperextension proved that all the good I was already doing did not achieve the results the Reverse Hyper did. Since that time it has become a standard part of all my training and treatment programs. It is an incredibly safe exercise in the hands of a qualified practitioner or strength and conditioning instructor.\nI have had severe pain patients with lumbar fusions and herniation’s perform the exercise achieving long term clinical success. While filming the lumbo –pelvic area with Digital Motion X-Ray using the reverse hyperextension, patients and clinicians can see what is happening at the spinal level, in real time, with these significant injuries and chronic post-surgical pain patients. These examples can be seen on my YouTube page on my website www.performancechirowellness.com. I have used this exercise with many people with similar histories and have numerous testimonials how it literally changed their life. The Reverse Hyperextension is something individuals can continue to do for themselves, without the need to rely on another person; self-empowerment is important for any long term success. As beneficial as this has proven to be, it amazes me how many personal trainers, strength coaches and self-proclaimed serious lifters / bodybuilders have never even heard of the Reverse Hyperextension and will try to defend what they do as working better. The explanation and x-ray graphics of the exercise speak for themselves, but the uniqueness of the exercises can only be experienced by using the Reverse Hyperextension machine itself (not re-creating the movement on an exercise ball or counter-top and definitely not a hyperextension exercise). By placing appropriate resistance for the individual on the Reverse Hyperextension and performing the motion within the patients’ initial capabilities, the clinical and performance potential becomes apparent.\nThe information below may benefit you in further understanding the injury process and some additional modes of treatment.\nStatic Decompression machines have been used for decades and have shown benefits to those suffering for back pain and who already have spinal degeneration.\nActive Decompression The reverse hyperextension exercise takes the benefits of static decompression and includes the benefits of activating the nervous system, improve circulation and many tissue regeneration factors.\nMany people have been through complete rehab sessions and even have had surgery and continue to have back pain. Others have their quality of life limited because they “know their limits” or were told “its old age and you will have to learn to live with it” and are destined for consistent degeneration and weight gain because they are unable to be active for fear of hurting themselves. In the majority of these pain patients, a proper understanding of the total problem was not identified, let alone explained, and no solution is provided.\nEveryone has their weakened areas due to accumulated trauma from falls, car accidents, repetitive stress, sports injuries, muscle asymmetry, inflexibility, and dysfunctional movement patterns. A clinician can consider further metabolic factors such as improper EFA ratios, mitochondrial damage, chemical toxicities that tear down the physical structure and more. In every injury, every time, it is important to remember that it is the muscles stabilize joints and are involved locally and globally by a neuro-musculo-skeletal-fascial system. If the muscles are not working properly, the joint is predisposed to an injury. If there is an existing injury, it promotes an inflammatory pain response throughout the nervous system (due to down regulation of muscle spindle fibers and lack of inhibition of Type C pain fibers). Muscles affect structure and structure affects muscles; prolonged stress on either of these systems fatigues (injures) the nervous system: specifically at the mitochondrial DNA level (Mitochondrial DNA in Aging and Disease Scientific American; Aug 1997 page 40). When the nervous system can no longer compensate, physical breakdown of the body occurs. This breakdown is revealed by acute and chronic pain with degeneration to ligaments, cartilage, joints, triggers points and pulled muscles. All of these contributing factors apply to science of “Mechanobiology”.\nMechanobiology and Diseases of MechanotransductionAnnals of Medicine 2OO3;35(8),pp.564-77Donald E Ingber, MD, PhD from the Vascular Biology Program, Departments of Surgery and Pathology, Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School\nThe main goal of the article is to help integrate mechanics into our understanding of the molecular basis of physical and visceral disease. This article first reviews the key roles that physical forces, extracellular matrix and cell structure play in the control of normal development as well as in the maintenance of tissue form and function. The article explains insights into cellular mechanotransduction, the molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to mechanical stress [for many of us is the application of proper exercise]. Re-evaluation of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that a wide range of diseases included within virtually all fields of medicine and surgery share a common feature: their etiology or clinical presentation results from abnormal mechanotransduction. “These new insights into mechanobiology suggest that many ostensibly unrelated disease share a common dependence of abnormal mechanotransduction.\nThere are many more important concepts that are described throughout the entire article which apply, not only to physical and visceral pathology, but describe taking a proactive approach in developing healthy athletes.\nWe can begin to safely and effectively correct the muscular imbalances, which will correct the global structural problems and therefore allow the nervous system to heal the pain response via retraining lower and upper motor neurons (neuroplastic changes). The Reverse HyperExtension is an invaluable asset toward building strength in the posterior kinematic chain, correcting muscular imbalances, remodeling fascia, increasing circulation and increasing intersegmental motion.\nThe muscular pattern that commonly needs to be corrected, starting from the pelvis:\nShort Muscles (need to stretch) Lengthened Muscles (need to contract)\nIliopsoas Gluteus MaximusQuadriceps Hamstrings/Gluteus MaximusTensor Fascia Latae Gluteus MediusAdductor group Gluteus MediusErector Spinae Transverse abdominalis, internal obliqueGastrocnemius, soleus Anterior Tibialis\nThe muscle imbalances and postural distortion extends to the upper body;\nShort Muscles (stretch) Lengthened Muscles (contract)Pectoralis Major Rhomboid Group\nPectoralis Minor, Levator Scapulae Lower TrapeziusTeres Major, Upper Trapezius Serratus Anterior\nAnterior Deltoid Posterior Deltoid\nSubscapularis, Teres Major Teres Minor, Posterior DeltoidLatissimus Dorsi Infraspinatus\nSternocleidomastoid, Scalenes Longus Coli, Longus CapitusRectus Capitus\nIt is the total pattern of all muscles working synergistically that determine spine stability, position, neurological patterning and ultimately functional movement and performance capabilities. Another point that needs to be made is that intermuscular coordination between muscles groups is a must. The column on the left directly affects the column on the right and vice versa (agonist / antagonist relationship). When the right iliopsoas (hip flexor) is contracting, lifting the right leg up, the right gluteus maximus (buttock) is supposed to be relaxed or inhibited. When the right gluteus maximus is contracting, extending the right leg backward, the right iliopsoas is supposed to be relaxed or inhibited. This patterning is necessary throughout all the above muscle relationships. Those who have chronic and/or recurring pain commonly have anatomical imbalances as well as the muscle fascilitory and reflexive pathways firing improperly which leads to muscles constantly turned off, others constantly spasm and then maintain instability and injury. The agonist / antagonist pattern above is further extended to the right upper quadrant and the left lower quadrant; neurological inhibition. The body’s motor learning pattern must be trained and strengthened! A chiropractor that is trained in resetting neurological patterning can provide an accurate evaluation and correction with proper adjustments, soft tissue work, low level laser therapy and ultimately a strength and conditioning program retraining and strengthening the optimum pattern.\nProper motion is necessary to recover from chronic injuries. Many prescribed exercises place too much compression on the injured area or try to isolate an area of involvement instead of strengthening an entire area that works together naturally.\nThe Reverse Hyperextension has numerous advantages for those suffering from back pain.\n1. There is no compression to the injured spine and discs. The motion of the reverse hyperextension actually “de-compresses” the spine and opens up the joint space on the forward swing phase.2. The exercise is performed as an “active”) therapy so there is an action potential throughout the nervous system and activation of muscle spindle fibers on the swing phase and the contraction phase. This action is retraining the nervous system to “close” the pain gate.3. The reverse hyperextension increases circulation to the injured area by pumping cerebral spinal fluid, lymphatic fluid and blood to the area. Circulation is necessary to bring in repairing nutrients and eliminate waste products. This process is necessary for the muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and the nervous system to heal.4. Imbibition – The Inter-Vertebral Disc is an important component of the spinal column. Together the discs compose one third of the height of the column. The disc itself is made of collagen, and cartilage. An important aspect of the disc is that it has a very poor blood supply. The only process by which it can receive nutrients is via imbibition. Imbibition refers to the exchange of fluid via movement. The reverse hyperextension “active decompression” exercise provides imbibition more than anything else I can provide my patients and clients with.\nIf you are suffering from back pain, your body has been in a degenerative and injured state for some time. The reverse hyperextension will help retrain and regenerate your body, no matter what your condition level is when you begin. Consistent use of the reverse hyperextension will allow progress to be made and will result in a decrease in symptoms if you follow these helpful guidelines.\n1. Start out cautiously! The reverse hyperextension is a very safe and effective exercise; however, your weak and injured low back is not used to having the joints, muscles, ligaments and bones move through normal range of motion or work together properly. Initially you are retraining the body and helping it relearn this process. This takes repetition, consistency and conservative progress. Beginning at a conservative level ensures long-term success and recovery.2. Initially, the full range of motion may not be possible with the reverse hyperextension in the forward swing phase. In addition, you may not be able to extend your legs up to the full extension (muscle contraction) phase. It is recommended to start with a short range of motion and gently increase as you warm up.3. In the beginning, patients and clients may feel muscle fatigue and some mild discomfort. This is normal and should not be mistaken for injury to the weakened area. As people age or for those with chronic back conditions; bone strength and muscle elasticity and tone tend to decrease. The discs begin to lose fluid and flexibility, which decreases their ability to properly distribute weight-bearing forces. Additionally, scar tissue does not have the strength or flexibility of normal tissue. A small effort performed more often is safer and more effective than too much effort in the beginning!4. Revaluate yourself at the end of every week, for the first four weeks. You may be surprised at your progress and the general improvement in your symptoms; seeing increases in your range of motion, the number of repetitions and sets performed, the amount of weight resistance being used during the exercise.\nA rehabilitation program using the reverse hyperextension is based on your current condition, consistency of use and continued increases in repetitions, sets of performing the exercise, and by adding increased resistance to continually build your core strength and achieve a more healthy, pain free life. For those who are doing a complete strength and conditioning program you don’t fix the roof when it is raining. Implementing the reverse hyperextension into your program is one of the most beneficial, unique exercises you can ever do.\nIf you do have a diagnosed condition it is always beneficial to have a practitioner than can coordinate a complete program and provide services that you cannot do for yourself. Chiropractic adjustments are proven to be one of the most beneficial treatments even when used only by themselves for people with chronic pain. Chiropractic is a form of treatment that seeks to return proper function to the nervous system: not just for putting bones back into place. There are numerous studies that prove chiropractic is one of the most effective and the safest treatment for the elimination of pain. This is due to the fact that the spinal column has sensory receptors at the joints of the vertebrae (spinal bones) that transmit pain signals to the brain. If the bones are misaligned or not moving properly this creates improper neurological communication (subluxations) locally and globally throughout the body. Pain is a normal response to injury and instability of joints. The below research paper validates the effectiveness of the chiropractic adjustment, acupuncture compared to commonly prescribed drugs individually. NOTE: Spine is the #1 orthopedic journal in the world.\nChronic Spinal Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Medication, Acupuncture, and Spinal ManipulationSpine, July 15, 20O3;28( L4): 149O-150 KEY POINTS OF STUDY\nIn this study, the medication group had more patients’ experienced adverse side effect (6.1%) than recovered from their spinal complaints (5%). Even though the chiropractic treatment group was the most chronic (8.3 years), 27.3 % recovered with 18 spinal adjustments over a period of 9 weeks, or less. This means that better than every fourth patient became asymptomatic with 9 weeks or less with chiropractic adjustments, even though they had been chronic for more than 8 years.\nChiropractic adjustments not only had the largest improvement in pain but also had the largest improvement in removing any symptomatology (indigestion, headaches etc) of all standardized measurements of health status.\nBecause the patients had chronic spinal pain syndromes, it is unlikely that improvement resulted from “self-limiting” spinal pain, as could be the case with acute spinal pain.\nChiropractors are the only health care specialists that are trained in administering specific adjustments (not gross manipulations) to restore proper biomechanics and communication to help reduce and eliminate pain related to mechanobiology stresses.\nAnother unique modality worth mentioning is Low Level Laser Therapy (3LT), commonly known as LLLT. Most people are familiar with hot lasers that used for surgical precision; low level lasers (cold lasers) are used for healing precision. Low Level Laser Therapy (3LT) is a form of phototherapy which involves the application of low power coherent light (below 25 mw qualifies as true LLLT) to injuries and lesions to stimulate healing. Low Level Laser Therapy (3LT) is not to be confused with Led Emitting Diodes (LED’s) or “Infra-Red Light Therapy Devices. Erchonia Laser is the most researched and validated Low Level Laser in the world, having numerous FDA clearances and is published in many peer reviewed medical journals.\nThe effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (3LT) are photochemical / photobiological (cold), not thermal. During treatment of the tissue with the laser beam, an interaction between cells and photons takes place—a photochemical reaction. A very short explanation as to how this benefits athletes and patients is a photon provides an electron that passes through the electron transport chain of the mitochondria and increases the production of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate). A further explanation involves how the process effects the valence electron and utilizes integrins that ultimately can have numerous physiological benefits throughout the body for recovery of athletes as well as a variety of needs of patient care. Since every cell in the body has mitochondria and the biological effects are well documented for a variety of uses (just type in low level leaser therapy into www.pubmed.gov). Low Level Laser Therapy (3LT) works when used alone but if combined with exercise such as the Reverse Hyperextension, chiropractic and more the results are even more apparent. Dr. Jerome Rerucha is an expert in the field of Cold Laser Therapy. He lectures throughout the US and internationally on the use of Erchonia Lasers, Adjustors and Percussors. His laser and integrative protocols have helped doctors enhance their treatment skills, while improving the health and recovery of patients and elite athletes. In his role as Erchonia Multidiscipline Clinical Support, Dr. Jerome has provided protocols and training for 1000’s of Erchonia Client Healthcare Practitioners that include: Chiropractors, Rolfers, Acupuncturists, Physical Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Veterinarians, Naturopaths and Medical providers.",

We always respond with an answer based on a strong foundation of knowledge and experience. But is it always the right answer? We like to think so, but reality is that, just as we have done many things the right way, we have also done many things the wrong way at Westside. But once we find what we believe was the right way to do something and it turns out to actually be the wrong way, we refuse to repeat it. If doing something is not advantageous, then it is disadvantageous. In this article I will present to you some of the most common mistakes being made by lifters that we have corrected.\nBENCHING\nAlways push the bar in a straight line up from where it makes contact with your lower chest–not from your chest in an arc back over your face. If you’re pushing the bar back over your face, you end up rotating the elbows outward, which cause a rotator injury and pec tears. When taking the bar out of the rack, take it out over the stomach and lower it in a straight line, then concentrically press straight upward. The elbows will remain under the bar at all times–no rotating, no injuries. This requires strong triceps and lats, along with strong rear and side delts. The triceps must be the strongest muscle group involved in this lift. This ensures that the triceps start the lift, and not the pecs that are highly susceptible to injury. The delts are also easy to injure, as well, but we see very few tricep injuries. It’s better to use your thumb around the bar than a thumb-less grip because the harder you squeeze the bar, more muscles get activated.Do not overarch the lower back; the upper back supports the weight of the bar.\nDo not lower the bar too slowly–faster is better, as long as you maintain control. This way, you’ll have more reversal strength (40% of your eccentric muscle potential is optimal).\nIf you tuck your feet up close to your hips, you will lose leg drive. If your butt comes off the bench, flare your feet out in front of the bench and push with your heels.\nIf you are weak off the chest, build your upper back and lats; the lats control the path of the bar. If you lack strength at lock out, build your triceps, work on bar speed, both eccentrically and concentrically, and always use bands or chains for explosive and speed strength work. Use 25% to 30% at lockout with good tension also at the chest.\nBENCH SHIRT WORK\nThe biggest mistake we see is jacking up the shirt to break a board record. No one cares what you board press–only what you can touch to your chest and lockout.The strongest raw lifter will not always be the strongest bench shirted lifter; some lifters can’t take the extreme pressure of a good shirt.If you have not learned to pull a bar out of the rack, do not take a hand out raw until you learn to pull the bar over the right spot with your lats. A lifter who pushes the bar backward into the bench supports or causes the plates shake is not using his lats.\nMEET DAY\nDo not open with a weight that will not touch your chest due to the restrictions of the shirt.Not having a wide grip may take your triceps out of the lockout.Bench shirt selection is an individual choice. Westside Barbell uses Inzer gear.\nDEADLIFTING\nA common mistake is pulling the bar straight up. It must be pulled into the body, toward the body’s center of mass. To help with this, chair deadlifting and bands from the front both pull the bar forward so you must concentrate on pulling the bar toward you as hard as possible.Don’t start with your legs too low, this places the hip joint far away from the bar, when biomechanically your hips must be close to the bar as possible from the start of the lift through the finish.If you feel the majority of the deadlift in any one muscle group, your form is incorrect. The work should be distributed equally between the legs, hips, and back.Don’t use a suit that will not let you get into a proper squatting position.Always open light. It’s not what you open with… it’s what you finish with.\nSPECIAL EXERCISES FOR BENCHING AND DEADLIFTING\nAfter the bench or deadlift, pick three to four special exercises for both lifts. For benching, the lifter should do two sets of dumbbell presses in one of four angles, with moderate weight. For example, you could perform dumbbell presses for 50 pounds for easy sets of 15 reps, then tricep extensions, followed by upper back and lats, and finally rear and side delts. For deadlifting, do reverse hypers, inverse curls, rows, and abs. Remember that 80% of your training should consist of special exercises, and only 20% with the classic lifts. For recovery, 72 hours should separate speed and max effort workouts. Small workouts can be done on off days or later in the day.\nThere are still many more mistakes and how to correct that we haven’t yet covered, so look forward to Training Mistakes – Part Two, WS RULES,LOUIE",

I was a Top 8 bencher in 1980 with a 480lb lift at 220, without a shirt. There were no bench shirts until around 1984. I was Top 6 in 2002 with a 575lb lift at 220 in a shirt. If I could make a Top 10 bench for 32 years, so can you- here’s how.\nIn 1971, I had a 340lb raw bench. Larry Pacifico said I had to raise my bench if I was going to win a national title. Not long after, I met Bill Seno; he was a bodybuilder/powerlifter, which was common in the 1970’s. Bill was a bench record holder as well. He used a close grip style, with his massive size. Bill told me to bench ultra wide (illegal grip), one inch outside of the rings. He recommended that I do a six rep max week after week, until I could go no further. At that point, he said to go eight reps until I could no longer make progress, then on to ten reps, and again to failure. At that point, he recommended returning to sixes, and repeating the cycle- going for a new record with six reps, then eight, and so on.\nDid it work? It took my 340lb bench at 172lb body weight, to a 515lb bench at 212lb body weight. Warm up a lot, and make smart jumps. A 3-week wave at one weight worked best for me. Thanks, Bill.\nIf you are going to bench big raw, you need to get bigger. My version was to do a top set of three at one weight. My best was 13, 11, and 9 reps with 155lbs, 23, 21, and 19 reps with 125lbs, and 29, 24, and 20 reps with 100lbs. You will need about six minutes between each set to fully recover. Use one bar weight per workout. I used a flat bench, but I kept records on all floor angles- flat, seated, incline, and decline.\nA lot of my bench training came from East German shot putters. They would do four sets of a moderate weight every other day, always alternating angles. Today, we do two sets after speed or a max effort workout. This keeps us from overtraining one muscle group that would otherwise result in a muscle imbalance.\nPat Casey was an original Westsider, and was big on dumbbells- just like Jim Williams, who made a 675 raw bench in 1972. Incidentally, Pat was the first 600lb bencher (officially), and also held the world record in the squat (as did Mr. Williams). Larry Pacifico also told me and anyone who would listen, to train the triceps like crazy. He thought 75% of your bench came from the triceps, and I later found this to be true.\nSo how does Westside train their triceps? Every way possible.\nFirst, you can do laying extensions with a straight or EZ curl bar, in many different varieties: bar to forehead, bar to nose, bar touching, and bar to throat. The throat is the most demanding on the elbows, but very effective. A total of 50-70 reps is standard with heavy weight.\nA J.M. press is a 75% extension, and 25% bench. To perform, lay flat and lower the bar straight down over the upper chest, using a close grip. Then roll the bar back toward the throat while raising the elbows upward, and press up.\nYou can also do dumbbell extensions, lowering then to the upper chest, as the elbows stay out to the sides. An incline works best for these. You can also do dumbbell rollbacks on a flat bench, lowering the dumbbells to touch the shoulders, rolling back to the rear as far as possible and pressing back through to the top. We will do 60-80 total reps of these movements.\nIn addition to the tricep work, you will need to add in upper back, rear and side delt work, and hammer curls.\nMORE TIPS\nUse one day for explosive power; this will be 40-50% of your 1RM + 25% tension at the top with either chain or bands. To reduce bar deceleration after speed benching, do the high rep dumbbell presses, then extensions.\nOn max effort day, rotate the bar exercise each week. Rack press on two different height pins, board press to a 4 and 3-board, a 3 and 2- board, or a 2 and 1-board. Floor press, incline, and decline press should also be rotated in. Follow a 1RM with a top set of 6, 8, or 10 reps for added muscle mass.\nWhen pressing, press the bar straight up, not over your face.\nFollow the two day system, 72-hours apart for optimal recovery, and watch your bench soar.

Kinetic Energy and not heavy weights must be used. Depth jumps and med ball re-bounding are two common means used. Dr. Verkhoshansky, the father of plyometrics first thoughts came by observing triple jumpers and how powerful the jumps were after each landing. This he knew, that the powerful jumps came after the athletes falling body reacted to the impact of the contact to the ground. This made Verkhoshansky aware of the stretch-shortening action by the use of kinetic energy. Many believe that plyometric’ s are dangerous, they can be without the proper knowledge of general weight and jump training before engaging in depth jumps. While depth jumps build explosive strength, they also build absolute strength by using different heights to achieve a certain goal. How many drops are done in one workout for the intermediate or advanced. You will note Olympic lifting is never mentioned when the goal is developing explosive power or strength. Why?\nStrength is not measured in heavy or light weights. What is a heavy 300lb squat for a female sprinter would be light for a world class shot putter. So how can one weight be heavy and light? It can’t, but rather fast or slow. Strength is measured in velocities.\nExplosive = fast velocity\nSpeed Strength = intermediate velocity\nStrength Speed = low velocity\nIsometric = zero velocity\nThis is explained on pg. 150 in Supertraining sixth edition 2003\nAre depth jumps and bounding safe?Just as safe as running, jumping or many other ballistic sport activities. What makes them unsafe is a lack of a complete training system. Before the subject of plyometric training, we must first prescribe a sound weight training and jump training. Let’s look at the three proven methods of weight training.\n1. Maximal Effort Method\nThis is the greatest method of strength training for improving both intermuscular and intramuscular coordination, as your body only adapts to the load placed on it. Then to use after a warm up to single attempts until setting a new record. Stop for the day and 7 days later switch a special barbell exercise and max out once more. This is low volume, highest intensity training followed by 3-4 small special exercises.\n2. The Dynamic Method\nThis method improves the rate of force development and speed and explosive strength. It is no use to build maximal strength, but certainly had a lot to do with its development. As your max’s go up are you able to maintain the same bar speed at sub maximal weights. 50% of speed strength should be at 50% to 60% of a one rep max with 25% band tension at the lockout. Roughly 0.8 to 0.9 m/s on average. This is mechanical power.\n3. The Repetition Method\nThis method should not be done in the classical lift, but in small exercises. Especially for the posterior chain. Note: the posterior chain is talked about all the time, but I see athletes constantly lack strength in that area. 80% of Westside training is small, special exercises, while only 20% are classical.\n4. The Maximal Effort Method\nThis method uses slow velocity while the dynamic method uses intermediate velocity. The two methods make it possible to absorb the harsh training plyometric domains of the athlete. Explosive strength is trained at fast velocity. It is trained by a variety of special exercises with and without weights or other resistance.\nBasic Jump Program\nA group of jumping exercises that first came from dance and later incorporated into weight lifting and track and field. Seated press on the floor. All around consider kneeling squats front and back, jumping on the feet. Power clean off knee’s onto feet, power snatch off knees onto feet and power clean or snatch off knees onto feet split style. Add weights when possible while keeping records on each type of jump.\nNext, box jumping with weights, use kettlebells, weight vest, ankle weights and combos of all types. Keep records of every type, always rotating each jump session to avoid accommodation. 40 jumps per workout for the very strong or at least advanced athlete 18yrs and older. To round out the athletes preparatory phase, power walk with sleds. This will build strong jumping and running muscles as well as thicker ligaments and tendons including the feet where many career ending or at least season injuries occur. Westside DVD’s cover all the above info on the volume and intensity. The coach and athlete must learn to train smarter not harder like ACDC said, it’s a long road if you want to reach the top. Now you are ready for plyometric training. Like all the shock methods can be taxing, plyometrics are no different.\nSo before depth jumps let’s look at several types of bounding with ground contact under 0.2 of a second. 1. Single take-off jumps on stairs 2. Leg to leg jumps: single, triple, 5’s and 10’s 3. Double leg jumps over 5-10 or 15 low hurdles 4. Double leg jumps over high hurdles of 40-42” 5. Slow bounds with submaximal effort in a controlled style 6. Frog jumps 7. 3 jumps off left foot then 3 jumps off right foot 8. 20-40/60 meter leg to leg bounds with light resistance 10-20-30lbs with Bulgarian bag 9. Standing long jumps (keep records) 10. Standing long jumps with kettlebells, release before landing\nThe above jumps should be done and weight lifting dynamic or max effort with a 30 minute rest from the barbell lifts.\nExplosive Weight Jumps\nDo single to a triple with 30% of a one rep max or 10 – 15% of a one rep max with kettlebells or Bulgarian bags for 10 – 20 reps, stop when fatigue sets in. While Dr. Verkhoshansky uses contracts training with a heavy barbell for 1-2 reps at 90% immediately followed by 30% barbell jumps, Westside uses band resistance by the barbell for an over speed eccentric phase to produce more kinetic energy for re-usable strength and the bands give accommodation to eliminate bar deceleration.\nDepth Jumps\nFirst, what is the goal? Explosive power or absolute strength?\nThe height of the drop will determine the outcome. 36 inch drops and lower will build explosive power. Drop jumps of 45 inches and higher will build absolute strength but can be very dangerous, never for beginners or large, over 125kg athletes. To time of the fall until ground contact will determine the amortization phase or shock absorption phase which must be 0.2 of a second or faster to be considered a plyometric action. When falling from a greater height, the shock absorption phase will be longer, mainly training a strong isometric contraction in the leg muscles. 4 sets of 10 drops for the advanced and 3 sets of 8 drops for well trained. Remember the amortization phase is most important. In the beginning drop off a low box 12-16-20 inches. The coach must analyze the time spent on the ground just like sprinting, the less ground contact, the better.\nDepth Drops vs. Depth Jumps\nDepth drops will provide the ability to absorb the shock of the fall, but are not as effective due to not using an energetic take off to develop reactive ability. Like many things there are many varieties of depth jumps, but like box squats there is only one correct method. Note: I am always amazed that great sport scientist like Dr. Verkhoshansky spent years perfecting the perfect technique in a proven exercise, only to have un-experienced coaches use their own ideas that lead to less than favorable results, then assume the inventor was wrong in his assumption of its value. So to reduce the risk of injuries and to make depth jumps as valuable to the athlete as possible. I will describe Dr Verkhoshansky’s method for performing the exercise.\nDepth Jump\nThe athlete must start with arms behind the back, then step off a pre-determined height box with one leg stepping forward at the start of the fall. Now bring the other leg forward to even. After stepping off the box the legs must be straight. Remember do not jump but fall from the box forward, straight down to the landing surface.\nHow to Land\nThe athlete must land on both legs simultaneously on the balls of the feet, then back on the heels. Now, upon landing be flexible to cushion the surface contact before the takeoff.\nThe Takeoff Phase\nThe athlete now must jump as high as possible. One can set a vertical jump tester to establish the height to reach. Try new records and keep records from different height drops. I prefer to drop jump from a pre-determined box and jump upward on the second box. This is somewhat less taxing because your velocity is near zero upon landing on an elevated box. When jumping upward to touch a new height you now must once again do a safe landing to try to land as easy as possible on the balls of both feet with a flexible surface (rubber mats or foam).\nNote: Because depth jumps can alter the work load to such an extent you must limit some squatting and pulling exercises during depth jump training.\nWestside uses the recommendations of Dr. Verkhoshansky. 4 sets of 10 jumps two times a week. Average drop height is 30 inches. 3 sets of 8 jumps for not so advanced, meaning well trained and very strong. Our weight jumps use the same loading. Remember you must be physically prepared to do depth jumps. Weight training for max strength, speed strength and explosive through jumping up onto boxes. A large base for GPP is sled work, wheel barrow push and 80% of the training must be small special exercises.\nRecommended Reading:Supertraining by Mel Siff; Science and Practice of Strength Training by V.

Despite its proven ineffectiveness, it is still being taught in universities and followed religiously by numerous “strength coaches.” The name of this incorrect training method is Progressive Gradual Overload.\nPROGRESSIVE GRADUAL OVERLOAD\nThis system of training increases intensity while decreasing the volume of work. The first phase of this system stimulates muscle hypertrophy, which is followed by the power phase where strength is increased by lifting intermediate weights while using maximum acceleration. Unfortunately, 14 to 21 days into this phase, the muscle mass gained during the first phase begins to atrophy. Following the power phase is the maximal strength phase; whereby, the weights being lifted become increasingly heavier as a contest nears. Therefore, abandoning the power phase for 14 to 21 days can stunt or lessen strength development.\nThus, the progressive gradual overload system has set a lifter up for failure! Completing all the phases of this system causes an athlete to lose the volume of training needed to lift a new all-time max. Meet day is when special strength qualities are really needed; however, due to this faulty training system, an individual has less muscle, less bar speed, and a lack of training volume necessary to produce a new personal best lift.\nThe progressive gradual overload system and other incorrect training methods have proven to be inferior to forms of wave periodization, such as the Westside Barbell Conjugate System.\nTRAINING CORRECTLY\nTHE WESTSIDE BARBELL CONJUGATE SYSTEM\nThrough endless research, I have determined that a standard amount of training volume is required to just sustain a lift, or maintain a time for running a specified distance. I also concluded that special exercises are required to ensure maximum success. These special exercises are responsible for strengthening weaknesses that cause subpar results. Many special strengths are needed for an athlete to develop to advanced states, such as: aerobic and non-aerobic segments for long or middle distance runners, and the blending of general physical preparedness (GPP) and special specific physical preparation (SPP) training for weight lifters or powerlifters. This is why Westside uses three scientific methods of strength training in a weekly rotation.\nTHE DYNAMIC EFFORT METHOD\nDynamic effort lifts involve moving a submaximal weight with maximal speed. This method is not used for maximal strength because it is impossible to obtain Fmm (maximal force) with fast movements when using intermediate resistance. Its purpose is to improve a faster rate of force development and explosive strength.\nTHE MAXIMAL EFFORT METHOD\nThe Maximal Effort Method is defined as lifting a maximal load against maximal resistance. For the greatest strength gains, the maximal effort method is superior to all others. It is far better for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. Science dictates that the muscles and central nervous system (CNS) adapt only to the load placed upon them. Maximal effort means a single all-out max attempt, not two or three reps, which is for building strength endurance.\nTHE REPETITION METHOD\nThis training system is the most common method used among fitness enthusiasts and bodybuilders. After the speed or maximal effort workout, an individual must follow up with 3-4 small exercises. Size, strength endurance, and restoration can all be achieved through implementing the repetition method. It is a simple, yet effective, way to raise work capacity and volume to increase a lift total. If explosive strength work is needed, then more jumping, bounding, and depth jumps should be added to an athlete’s routine. Special accessory work should be the largest volume of training, accounting for 75% to 80% of the total training volume.\nIncorporating these methods into a rotating weekly routine enables an individual to evaluate weekly progress by allowing him to precisely, not hypothetically, know how fast and how strong he is getting and which areas need improvement.\nWHY THE WESTSIDE SYSTEM RULES\nMany thanks are owed to the scientists whose works I have studied and applied for more than 30 years. This has included the principles of Vorobyev and Ermakov along with A.S. Primlim’s loading by intensity zones (the study that has intrigued me the most). Primlim determined, on a per workout basis, how many sets, reps per set, and total lifts at what percentages should be performed to achieve maximum results. I also learned by extensively studying the works of Yuri Verkhoshansky, Medvedev, and Arosiev on pendulum waves of periodization and the relationship between intensity and volume.\nWorking alongside Dr. Mel C. Siff at seminars while he was visiting Westside Barbell has also increased my own knowledge base. These three decades have been filled with years of blood, sweat, and tears that went into practical trial and error by Westside lifters, athletes, and myself, which included the application of principles of mathematics, physics, and biomechanics, making it possible for me to control weekly, monthly, yearly, and multi-year training protocols. All of this has resulted in the strength training methods that have enabled Westside lifters to continually break all-time world records and earning Westside Barbell the reputation of being the strongest gym in the world.\nGood luck and stay strong,\nLouie Simmons",

But the truth is the Westside System is used in track and field and in football at all levels. I am very proud to have a picture of Johnny Parker of the Patriots and Kent Johnston of the Packers on the Super Bowl field when they played each other in 1997. They both had spent a week at Westside to learn to implement some of our methods in their programs. Johnny Parker is now with the 49ers and recently spent a week again with the Westside guys.\nFive major rugby teams from Europe have visited us and have had great results. Pro boxers, MMA fighters, wrestlers, and more have used our system. Why? If nothing else, it was to produce stronger and more explosive leg strength.\nAbsolute strength controls all strength gains. Analysis of Hill’s equation shows that speed of movement is dependent on absolute muscular strength: v = Ft/m. This can be found in Fundamentals of Special Strength- Training in Sport (Verkhoshansky, 1986). Thomas Kurz, in Science of Sports Training, reported many ways to become more explosive, but the simplest is to increase absolute strength.\nOne must constantly raise one’s work capacity. This is a must for jumping and squatting. Bompa (1996) states that it can take 4 years to perform high-intensity plymometrics. Many books talk about methods and theories but do not talk about results. I love to read those books too, but more importantly, I love increasing results.\nSo, how do you build explosive leg strength? This can be accomplished through the reactive method, jumping off hard and soft surfaces, overspeed eccentrics, box squatting, which causes a virtual force effect, and accommodating resistance. There are two major components of explosive power: a fast rate of force development and increasing velocity. This applies to light objects, for example, a shot put, or a heavy object, for example, a max deadlift. Common sense and science tell us speed of movement is controlled by the amount of external resistance used. So light weight looks fast. But can light weight alone move a 320-pound lineman backward? No. Lifting light weight will always produce a deceleration phase.\nWe have extremely strong squatters at Westside: 1141 at SHW, 1118 at 275, 1025 at 220, 905 at 181, and 575 by a female at 148, the latter four being world records. We are also very explosive: 50- inch box jumps, a box jump of 35 inches holding a pair of 70-pound dumbbells at 290 pounds, a jump from a kneeling position to the feet with 255 pounds on the back at a body weight of 255.\nHOW IS THIS DONE?\nThe dynamic method is essential. This will not increase maximal strength, but will increase the rate of force development and explosive strength. Here, box squatting is used for all squats. The box makes it possible to break the eccentric/concentric chain. The box height is just below parallel. The interval method is used. The rest between sets is 45-75 seconds. A 3-week pendulum wave is used. The percents used are 75, 80, and 85% of a max box squat record. Then wave back to 75% on the fourth week. As noted in Managing the Training of Weightlifters (Laputin and Oleshko), almost 50% of all lifts are at this percent for the snatch and clean/jerk and, for us, the squat.\nTo accommodate resistance, Jump-Stretch bands must be attached to the bar. A large load of bands will eliminate bar deceleration. They also increase the speed in the eccentric phase. An increase in velocity has an exponential effect on kinetic energy.\nWe ran a test on Matt Smith, a SHW who at the time had a 930 squat. Matt box squatted 550 pounds consisting of all barbell weight in roughly 0.9 seconds, both eccentrically and concentrically. Then Jump- Stretch bands were attached to the bar in addition to weight. The realized weight was 750 pounds at the top and 550 on the box. Because the bands pull the bar downward, the eccentric phase decreased to 0.5 seconds. The concentric phase was the same, 0.5 seconds. How did Matt do this with the added 200 pounds of band tension? Overspeed eccentrics. Matt has now squatted an official 1141 pounds. How’s that for results?\nNot only did bands increase kinetic energy but the actual collision that occurs when contacting the box also produces kinetic energy. The same process occurs when a sprinter comes in contact with the track at full speed.\nFor speed strength work, 75% of the total load should be from bands and 25% from weight. The concentric speed should be 1.0 to 1.3 meters/second. This will work regardless of your strength level. For strength speed, the ratio of weight to band tension is 50/50. The bar speed will be about 0.4 to 0.5 meters/second. This is where one becomes incredibly powerful, after removing the bands. Using a large amount of bands creates an overspeed eccentric phase, causing tremendous reversal strength. Note: band strength must be great at the bottom of the lift.\nTo become more explosive, one must constantly become stronger. This is exemplified by the famous weight lifter Naim Suleymanoglu. His best clean/jerk was about 407 pounds, in comparison to his front squat of 518. Weight lifters are very explosive, yet to become more explosive, Naim became very strong, having a surplus of 20% in the front squat to his clean/jerk.\nAnother example is the throwing events. The object being thrown is constant in weight, yet the thrower is always trying to become faster and stronger. My friend Jud Logan, a four-time Olympian in the hammer throw, was very strong and very explosive. His stats were as follows: 478 raw bench, 770 squat, 550 x 5 and 600 x 1 front squat, and 440 power clean. Like myself, in the 1980s his top strength grew but his throws stagnated. Some of his East German friends suggested he push his box jumps up. As he improved to 5 jumps on a 52-inch box and a single jump on a 56-inch box at about 275 pounds body weight, his throws began increasing. I experienced the same type of progress after I started to use the dynamic method in 1983.\nNot only does concentric speed has to be increased, but so does the eccentric phase, which is the most important, as has already been discussed. Speed has to do with external resistance. That may be why Olympic lifts are popular for building explosive strength. But if you do jumping, Olympic lifts are not needed. Many coaches will argue with me, but I’ve done it their way. They haven’t tried my way. At a Beat training center in Cincinatti, Matt Weiderman trained James Taylor, a pro football player, to jump onto a 59-inch box at 6′ 2” and 205 pounds. J.T. also ran a 4.33 40-yard. J.T.’s best box squat is 550 and moves 315 at 0.8 meters/second. John Harper can jump on a 51-inch box at 270 pounds; he is ranked 11th nationally in the discus.\nOne end of the spectrum is moving very heavy weights very slowly. The other end is to move the body as fast as possible. How? Jumping! A 42-inch box jump is the minimum height to reach an adequate amount of explosive power. We use the optimal number of jumps based on a maximum jump.\nWe use the formula as presented in Prelepin’s lift table. For example, if your best jump is 40 inches, a 75% jump would be 30 inches, 80% would be 32 inches, and 85% would be 34 inches. When doing jumps in the 80% range, do 15 jumps per workout. This holds also for jumping with dumbbells, ankle weights, or a weighted vest, or a combination of any of the above.\nAt Westside we do a lot of squats and jumps off soft surfaces. This causes the muscles to do more of the work and not limit it to the ligaments and tendons. In two out of three workouts we step down off the box onto other boxes. On the third workout, and highest box, we do a depth jump down onto a soft gym mat. We don’t do an immediate jump upon landing, just stick it with legs slightly bent, landing on the balls of the feet.\nOur goal is to jump as high as possible and, therefore, squat as much as possible. We do it the same way: off a box. We duplicate the same procedure as box squatting. Before jumping onto a box, we first sit on a box, relax, and then jump. This produces a much greater effort.\nThe forces that produce movement are external, internal, and reactive strengths. This was established by Bernstein (Verkhoshansky, 1986). When lowering onto a box, a greater amount of kinetic energy is expressed because mass as well as speed contribute to kinetic energy. Landing on the biggest part of the lower body will yield an increase in kinetic energy. In addition, by lifting the feet and slamming them on the floor an overspeed eccentric phase occurs. This combination very effectively increases jumping power. I have had veteran NFL linemen long jump their best in one or two sessions.\nThe stretch (eccentric) and shortening (concentric) phases cause reversible muscular action. If you do very heavy slow squats with the aid of overspeed eccentrics by using bands with weight and move the fastest with no resistance (box jumps), the sky’s the limit. Remember, explosive strength is somewhere between strength and speed. By using these two elements, you will reach your desired results.\nLouie Simmons",

Like the scholar who must utilize many sources of information to achieve a higher level of knowledge, the lifter must incorporate new and more difficult exercises to raise their standards. Many have the theory that to squat, bench, or deadlift more, you simply have to do the three lifts. If it were that simple no one would need special exercises, machines, or systems of training. But we know this is not true.\nBecause lifters have different body types, they may excel at one lift but struggle with another. The great Lamar Gant was the only lifter I have known who held the world record deadlift and bench at the same time. There are men who hold three world records in the deadlift, yet can’t make the top 10 bench list. Their muscles in the upper body are, I’m sure, as strong as anyone’s, but they are limited by body structure, e.g., short torso, long arms. Many of us are affected by this. But is there an answer?\nIn the early 1970s, the Dynamo Club in the former Soviet Union had 70 highly skilled Olympic lifters. They were introduced to a system of 20-45 special exercises that were grouped into 2-4 exercises per work-out and were rotated as often as necessary to make continuous progress They soon found out that as the squat, good morning, back raise, glute/ham raise, or special pulls got stronger, so did their Olympic lifts. When asked about the system, only one lifter was satisfied with the number of special lifts; the rest wanted more to choose from. And so the conjugate system was originated.\nWhen you have a body type that lacks say, the muscles that squat and yet you squat on a regular ba-sis, then a coupling of special exercises for the glutes, hamstrings, hips, and lower back are needed to fortify those areas. These special exercises will en-able you to raise your squat once more.\nThink about it if you read only one book, no matter how many times you read it, you will only learn so much. If you only squat, you will get only so strong because no new stimulus is introduced. This may not happen in the early stages of training, but as you become more advanced, you will need a more strenuous method of training. This training will indeed help your motor potential and help you to perfect your technical skill.\nBefore I present some examples of conjugate training, think about this. How much could you bench press the first time you tried? 200? 300 perhaps? Now how did you achieve that level of strength without ever having benched be-fore? You did it through simplified training such as pushups and pull-ups. Those of youwho could bench 300 the first time will never double that amount without doing specialized work to raise your strength, right?\nHere are some ex-amples of the conju-gate method. Glen Chabot bench presses only twice a month. Both times he uses a close-grip style He can do 405 for reps in the low teens. His best single close grip is 635 without a shirt. In be-tween each workout, he rotates heavy dumbbell work on a flat or incline bench or very heavy bodybuilding exercises for lats, delts, pecs, and triceps.\nThis linking of special exercises has given Glen a 705 bench press at 275. Glen does not arch when he benches and has fairly long arms. He realized that he needed a special program to fortify his pressing muscles. This is a simple but very effective training program.\nA more complex system is Kenny Patterson’s. He will do floor press, chain press, board press, incline press, and over-head press, just to name a few, rotating to a different- exercise each max effort day. On the dynamic day, Kenny uses three different grips on the bench press and uses 60% of his no-shirt max for 8 sets of 3 reps. He adds a lot of triceps extensions with dumbbells or the barbell, rows (one-arm, two-arm, chest-supported), pull downs, delt raises, and forearm work. This is a more complex system than Glen’s, but it suits Kenny’s needs. Kenny is a legitimate 700 bencher, having done it several times across the country.\nMike Ruggiera and myself just made 900 squats. It was a 50pound increase for him and a 40-pound increase for me, yet we did not do a single regular squat in between meets. We do box squats on speed days with a large amount of bands and weight. We also use the Re-verse hyper machine and do glute/ham raises, pull-throughs, and abs. I pull a weighted sled before my squat workouts.\nOn max effort day, we do good mornings (five varities), belt squats, speed deadlifts (60% for 6-8 singles), and Safety Power Squat Bar squats to different box heights. Mike also pulled his first 800 deadlift, without having done any conventional squats and no big deadlifts. After squatting he does deadlifts for singles with 60% for speed, and three days later he maxes out on special work: this is the conjugate method.\nTo push up a squat, heavy good mornings or squatting with different bars is done on max effort day. The different bars make squatting very awkward and extremely hard to do, much harder than a regular squat. (The same is true of box squats; they are harder than competition squats.) On max effort day we may do a type of squat on week 1, a good morning on week 2. and a front squat on week 3, each exercise contributing to the next week’s exercise, which in turn will build a bigger squat by strengthen-ing the weaker muscle group and perfecting form.\nThe training is linked together, enabling you to raise your total. For instance, to build the glute and hamstring area, push up your reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions as hard as possible until your progress slows. Move on to pull-throughs for a week or two, until progress in these slows as well. Then go to glute/ham raises, and again push as fast and hard as possible. Then pull a sled walking forward to build the glutes/hamstrings. It is possible to continuously gain strength in any body part by switching special exercises. As the effectiveness of the exercise decreases, switch to another one. By training in this manner, it is possible to raise all types of strength throughout the year.\nOn max effort day the entire volume consists of unidirectional loading. One training workout con-tributes to the next. Keep in mind that if you train a lift at 90% or more for more than 3 weeks, your central nervous system is negatively and your progress will go backward. But by switching exercises each week (for the high-level lifter), you can use 100% and more each week. The sequence of exercises you use does not matter, as long as the load is maximal. The time it takes to do a maximal effort, for example in a low box squat with a Manta Ray, takes at least as long as max deadlift or squat. This is called “time under tension”.\nThe conjugate method also improves SPP (special physical preparedness e.g., speed deadlifts, plyometrics) and GPP (general physical preparedness; e.g., sled drag-ging). This is the most effective method to gain strength continu-ously throughout the year, with no ridiculous off-season. No one can afford to take time off. By maintain-ing the speed work for the three lifts and increasing general wonk (e.g., upper and lower body sled work, lats, abs, and triceps) you won’t go back-ward.\nThere are many methods of training, but by incorporating the conjugate method, you can’t miss.\nLouie Simmons",

That’s a lot of back up. I am always explaining how our top athletes train to produce 13 all-time world records so far and within 4 weight classes, but how does a lifter train who is young and just getting their feet in the game?\nWell one such lifter is Jean Fry, a female lifter at 123 pounds body weight. She has a 415-pound squat, a 255-pound bench, and a 375-pound deadlift. Westside has had several lifters who had or have a push/pull combination record. They all train using the same methods during a weekly plan: the dynamic, the max effort, and the repetition methods. When I say there’s only one way to train, I am referring to these scientifically proven methods, not someone’s opinion.\nNow let’s look at how Jean trains the deadlift. On Friday Jean does speed strength squats first. She does 10 to 6 sets of box squats depending on the type of resistance used. After squatting, speed strength deadlifts are done. Jean will use about 100 pounds of band tension at the top of the pull. She uses either sumo or conventional style for the hips while standing on a 2-inch box for leg drive. When Jean uses the conventional style, she will usually stand on a 4-inch box. Speed strength pulls are also done in a power rack with just bar weight or some amount of band tension and always conventional style. Jean sometimes works out without gear; at other times she will wear Predator briefs. When she has a very taxing squat day on Friday, meaning high volume, or if doing a 2-week strength speed phase, she will reduce or completely eliminate any type of barbell exercises on Monday’s max effort workout.\nMonday is a hypertrophy workout for the back, legs, and abs plus flexibility or mobility, 3 days, or 72 hours, after the speed strength workout, which will allow her to achieve full recovery of the particular muscles used for squatting and deadlifting. Most of the research on the 72-hour recovery time was done on track and field athletes and weight lifters. Max effort day normally consists of a maximal effort on a special squat or a deadlift for a max single on that day. Reps of 2’s and 3’s will build endurance with a heavy weight. Think about it. You will always conserve yourself for the final rep. It also distorts the distribution of volume concerning the already high volume on speed strength day. Jean will do good mornings for 5 reps and reverse pyramids with one or two 10-rep sets. Jean uses several special bar exercises, a different one each week. Closer to a meet, she will eliminate the ones that do less for her strength and pick three or four exercises that work best for her strength. Let’s look at some of Jean’s special bar exercises that are most productive in a list of her more commonly used max-effort workouts.\nWorkout 1: Safety Squat Bar\nJean will work up to a max with the Safety Squat bar on a low, 12-inch box while using an ultra-wide stance. Some workouts are done without gear, while others are done wearing Predator briefs. After hitting a P.R. in this lift, a different version will be used for another max effort workout such as a close stance with or without gear. Safety Squat good mornings are used in some workouts. These are done either with a bend in the back or with an arched back. Some workouts are close stance; others are wide stance. The different styles will ensure that Jean uses all muscle groups. Workout 2: Rack Pulls\nThese are performed with the plates 2 ½ to 6 ½ inches off the floor. She will work up to a max single using one pin height per workout. Some workouts are done with just bar weight, while others are done with a variety of weights and band tension. Remember, use only one pin height per workout with or without band tension added and use a conventional stance only.\nWorkout 3: Box Deadlifts\nJean will pull standing on a 2-inch box for a max single. For other workout she will stand on a 4-inch box. She uses only bar weight with no bands 90% of the time. The box pulls are done with a close stance or sumo style. The sumo pulls are done either with feet out to the plates or with a normal sumo stance. Again some workouts are done with gear, while others are done without gear.\nWorkout 4: Front Squats\nJean does front squats with a front squat harness to save her wrists and shoulders. Jean wants to get the most out of the exercise and not let the exercise get the most out of her. All front squats are done on a 12- or 10-inch box with a long relaxation time (2 seconds). They are done with a very close stance for some workouts and very wide for others. Of course when she wears briefs, the weights are heavier, which puts more stress on the muscles above and below the briefs.\nWorkout 5: Ultra-wide Sumo Pulls\nJean will place her feet as close to the plates on the Texas deadlift bar without setting the plates down on her feet and then works up to a max single. She is ultra-flexible, so will sometimes pull ultra-wide on 2-inch mats.\nWorkout 6: 14-inch Cambered Bar\nOne of Jean’s favorite bars is the 14-inch cambered bar for box squatting or good mornings while using chains. The end result is more stability.\nThere are many more varieties of workouts. This is just an example of a few of Jean’s max effort lifts.\nSpecial ExercisesJust like everyone at Westside Jean relies heavily on special exercises for the back, legs, and abs. This is done normally for 3-8 sets depending on how she feels that particular workout day. For the back, reverse hyperextensions are done 4 times a week. They are done heavy on Monday (max effort day) and on Friday (speed squatting day), 4 sets of 10 to 12 reps on average. On the two bench days, she will do 2 sets for restoration. Belt squatting and walking in the belt squat machine develop her glutes, hips, and legs. An old lifting exercise from the former Soviet Union is to use this machine with the belt around the waist for lower body resistance while doing deadlifts and high pulls with kettlebells. Jean then does a lot of lat work on the lat machine, low-pulley work, or bent-over rows with a barbell or dumbbell. The inverse curl and hip machine are very beneficial to her success. She also does a lot of sit-ups and hanging leg raises, side bends, and kettlebell arm presses. Now you know how a 123-pound female athlete trains at Westside–just like the guys. Amy Weisberger and Laura Phelps, who has totaled 10 times her own body weight, also train the same. It’s the Westside system for all. Watch for Jean’s progress in the future.\nLouie Simmons",

Roberts has improved his squat from 1008 to 1140 pounds in just over 2 years by following the conjugate system. This includes a speed strength day, where a series of 3-week waves are performed. The percent of a 1-rep max used is 50% to 60% within the 3-week wave. Bands or chains or a combination of both is used to prevent accommodation.\nA.J. will use an assortment of bars such as a regular 65-pound Bulldog squat bar for a 3-week cycle. At other times a Safety squat bar, a bow bar, or a 14-inch cambered bar is often utilized. Sometimes a front squat apparatus will be used for sets. A.J. has a record for a max single for each type of bar he uses. Westside lifters discovered many years ago that a regular straight bar can cause shoulder discomfort as well as bicipital tendonitis even when using maximal hand spacing.\nIt is easy to manipulate the volume while doing the same percent, the same number of lifts in a set, and the same number of sets. After the speed strength sets are done, which occurs on Friday at Westside, 3 or 4 special exercises are selected and rotated when necessary.\nLet’s look at some examples of 3-week cycles, or speed strength phases, that A.J. uses. He will wear a Leviathan suit with the straps down and no knee wraps.

Almost always they are 3-week waves, and as you can see, the volume changes each week by changing the percentage. The bars change A.J.’s leverage, and changing from band tension to chains and to just bar weight further prevents accommodation. The squat is always done to a parallel box with a wide stance, except for front squats. At the end of some workouts the box is lowered. This is typical for all Westside lifters. The strength speed cycle will last only 2 weeks, as it is very taxing with the large amount of band tension. A.J. and our other 1000-pound-plus lifters use 700 pounds of band tension plus bar weight.\nBelow is an example of A.J.’s last strength speed 2-week cycle. WEEK 1\nBAR WEIGHT (LBS)\nBAND TENSION (LBS)\nREPS SET 1\n240\n700\n2 SET 2\n330\n700\n2 SET 3\n420\n700\n1 SET 4\n470\n700\n1 The 470 pounds plus 700 pounds of band tension was a personal record. WEEK 2\nBAR WEIGHT (LBS)\nBAND TENSION (LBS)\nREPS SET 1\n240\n700\n2 SET 2\n330\n700\n2 SET 3\n420\n700\n1 SET 4\n480\n700\n1 SET 5\n510\n700\n1 The 510 pounds plus 700 pounds of band tension was also a new personal record.\nThis concluded a 2-week strength cycle with two new records. Remember, a strength speed cycle lasts only 2 weeks. It is done twice a year. Why? Because A.J. normally competes twice a year. In 2011 A.J. broke the world record total three times. While doing this, two circa-max squat cycles were also done. It is very similar to a strength speed cycle but with more bar weight and less band tension. The total lifts over 90% of a 1-rep max are 4 minimum, 7 optimal, and 10 maximal. Westside lifters stay close to the optimal.\nHere is an example of A.J.’s circa-max phase. It is recommended to count lifts at 70% and above with a suit and briefs. WEEK 1\nBAR WEIGHT (LBS)\nBAND TENSION (LBS)\nREPS SET 1\n240\n440\n2 SET 2\n330\n440\n2 SET 3\n460\n440\n2 SET 4\n550\n440\n2 SET 5\n660\n440\n1 SET 6\n710\n440\n1 Set 6 with 710 pounds was a personal record with just Predator briefs. WEEK 2\nBAR WEIGHT (LBS)\nBAND TENSION (LBS)\nREPS SET 1\n240\n440\n2 SET 2\n330\n440\n2 SET 3\n460\n440\n2 SET 4\n510\n440\n2 WEEK 3\nBAR WEIGHT (LBS)\nBAND TENSION (LBS)\nREPS SET 1\n240\n140\n2 SET 2\n330\n140\n2 SET 3\n460\n140\n2 This concludes the circa-max phase in a 3-week wave. The third week with the 140 pounds of band tension is the second week of delayed transformation. Providing a week of rest gives A.J. 21 days from the heaviest squat. This makes it possible to be fully rested regarding the bench and deadlift. Seventy-two hours later the max effort workout is done on Monday.\nAll squat bars are used, but never a regular squat bar, and on some type of box. Deadlifts of all kinds are done, but seldom a regular deadlift, and an assortment of good mornings. Each week the exercise is rotated and is never done twice in a row. Below is a sample list of special exercises. Week 1 Front squat on a variety of boxes Week 2\nSafety squat bar on a variety of boxes Week 3\n14” cambered bar on a variety of boxes Week 4\nBow bar on a variety of boxes Week 5\nRack pulls, plates 3” off the floor Week 6\nRack pulls, plates 6” off the floor Week 7\nRack pulls, plates 9” off the floor Week 8\nRack pulls, plates any height with 250 lbs of band tension Week 9\nRack pulls, plates any height with 350 lbs of band tension Week 10\nBox pulls on a 2” or 4” box conventional Week 11\nBox pulls on a 2” or 4” box sumo Week 12\nDeadlift with 220 or 280 lbs of band tension Week 13\nConcentric good mornings Week 14\n14” cambered bar good mornings Week 15\nSafety squat good mornings A.J. has his favorites and uses a rotation of 5 or 6 special exercises. A.J. knows it does not do him any good to be strong in the wrong exercises, so he picks them carefully. Just like on speed day A.J. will do 3 or 4 special exercises for the low back, erectors, lats, hamstrings, and abs. His main exercises are as follows: Reverse Hyper machine\ninverse curls 45-degree hypers\nbent-over rows with a bar or dumbbells\nsled pulls\nall type of abs This is a standard program for A.J. and his training partners. Our top 5 official squats average 1160 pounds and are constantly going up.\nKeep an eye out for A.J.’s progress. There is always progress at Westside.\nLouie Simmons",

His raw bench has gone from 365 to 565, and his shirt bench has gone from 405 to 805 in 2 ½ years. How is this possible?\nLet’s start with dynamic bench day on Saturday. Nine sets of 3 reps are done within three-week waves using several different bars, band tensions, or chain combinations as a means of accommodating resistance. Now let’s look below at the speed strength waves. Remember, their purpose is to build a fast rate of force development and to teach acceleration.

Some waves are done with a thick squat bar or a bow bar that has a 2-inch camber.\nAfter the 9 sets of 3 reps of the dynamic bench, Travis will do 2 to 3 sets of dumbbell presses for 20 or more reps or a close grip bench. Different angles are used for each exercise: incline, decline, seated, or flat. This is for muscle building. After the high-rep pressing is completed, he will then move on to two heavy triceps exercises. These could be dumbbell roll-backs with elbows out to the sides, J.M. presses, or heavy kettlebell extensions. Many times Travis will rotate from heavy rep extensions (6-8 reps) to light weight reps (15-20 reps) to push-downs, cable push-downs, or band push-downs.\nTravis moves on to two back exercises such as heavy pull-downs, chest-supported rows, dumbbell rows, or a barbell row. Remember, only two exercises per workout, and rotate when necessary. High-rep deltoid exercises are next, and he concentrates on the rear and side delts because he does not want to overwork the front delts. Then it’s on to hammer curls, which is something that should always be done.\nWe have had five different men hold world records in the bench, and they all agree that the speed day is the most important. Anyone who disputes that speed is not important please read a basic physics book.\nWhen necessary, Travis will use no barbell exercises on max effort day but instead will use high-rep dumbbell presses at an angle he chooses. This is a hypertrophy workout, which also includes extensions, lat work of some type, and high-rep delt work. This style of workout is done when he feels somewhat worn out, but it allows him to resume his normal max effort workout the next week. The workout can also be done on a special day, as this workout is not by design but is based on instinct.\nOur max effort day is Wednesday, which is 72 hours after speed strength day. Travis uses several special exercises to max out on, and when we say “max out”, that means a top single for the day. Heavy 2’s or 3’s will not build maximum strength but instead strength endurance. On max effort day the volume must be as low as possible but the intensity high, that is, close to or more than your one-rep max (meaning an all-time record). It is recommended that three top weights are lifted per workout. This resembles a contest: one attempt at around 90%; the next attempt close to an all-time record; and then a lift slightly over the all-time record. If Travis’s level of preparedness is somewhat low, the three attempts should be based on his strength level at that given time.\nBelow is a list of sample max effort exercise that Travis rotates on his max day. 1. Mini-bands plus weight\n· His setup band tension will be 85 pounds at lockout.\n2. Monster bands plus weight\n· This will provide 125 pounds of tension at the top.\n3. Light bands plus weight\n· The tension is 200 pounds at the top.\nWith the three band tensions given above two grips are used, wide and close, wide meaning little finger on the power ring and close meaning index finger on the smooth part of the bar. By doing this, Travis has six exercises to choose from. He will also add a bow bar that has a 2-inch camber or a cambered bar that has a 3 ½-inch camber and a football bar to his list of exercises, so he has six more records to break. Incline and decline presses are rotated mostly without bands.\nAll the above mentioned max lift exercises are considered builder exercises for a bench press. Travis also has tester exercise such as a floor press with just bar weight or 120 pounds of chain. Again the two different grips are used, one wide and one narrow. Only one grip is used per workout. Other testers that he will use are 2- of 3-board presses with either a wide or close grip. These are mostly done with just bar weight. Travis will also use the lightened method at times. This exercise will reduce the load by 95 pounds at the top and by 150 pounds at the bottom. About once a month he will wear a bench shirt. As a meet is coming close, the last time he will use his shirt is on a 1-board press. Because bench max effort day is on a Wednesday, the last workout with a bench shirt is 17 or 18 days out from the contest. The last max effort workout is the floor press with just bar weight.\nIn summary, speed bench is on Saturday, and max effort bench is on Wednesday. A shirt is used 1 out of 4 workouts far away from a meet and 1 out of 3 workouts close to contest time. Both workouts are followed by lots of triceps work, upper back, lats, and last but not least rear and side delts plus hammer curls. Travis does some front delt work, but he says it is very easy to overtrain the front delts and that the triceps and upper back including lats are the most important for benching.\nIn my opinion Travis is just starting out and has limitless potential. I am very proud to be one of his training partners.\nLouie Simmons",

First, you need special bars. The theory of the conjugate system is to rotate exercises in some way to avoid accommodation. If your back squat is 800 pounds, you should be able to front squat a certain amount or at least have a personal record from which to gauge your back squat. Westside has a special harness for the Zercher squat. It has supports that can be used to do front squats as well. And speaking of Zercher squats, you must also have a Zercher record. As it goes up, so should your back squat. Westside uses many cambered bars. The Bow Bar has a 2-inch camber. It is used for good mornings, as well as for box squatting. It can save your biceps and shoulders, especially for large lifters. A 14-inch cambered bar is also used on max effort day as well as speed day. Chains make it very unstable, which in turn makes you very strong. We have a rackable cambered bar that fits in power racks and a 14-inch cambered bar that fits into a Monolift. Westside has had a Safety Squat bar since it was first advertised by “Dr. Squat”, Fred Hatfield. This bar also builds a strong deadlift just like front squats do for posture. You need the Bulldog squat bar that was used at the Powerstation Pro/Am, where Donnie Thompson squatted 1265pounds. And, of course, you need bands and chains.\nWestside uses lots of specialty bars for benching. First, the Bandbell bar is a fiberglass bar that vibrates when you hang kettlebells from it with the use of mini-bands. As it vibrates, it causes maximal contractions of the soft tissue. I used it to rehab my right shoulder after shoulder-replacement surgery. Three months after surgery I benched 300 pounds in a t-shirt. A great bar is the Football bar. It has three handles that run parallel to the body for better triceps activation. It’s great for speed benching or max effort day. The T-Grip barbell is a great bar to use in your rotation of exercises on either day. It comes with either one or two sets of handles; I suggest the two-handled bar. A wide variety of cambered bench bars are used by our lifters on each week of training. A bow bar is a 2-inch cambered bar that is thick. Most often, a 3-inch cambered bar is used at Westside. A 5-inch cambered bar is used by some of the smaller lifters. The only bench bar Westside uses is the one developed by Buddy Capps. It’s the best I have ever used, and it’s used all around the world. On speed development day, Westside uses bands to create tension ranging from 70 pounds using light bands up to 700 pounds using several bands together. Chains are used as well. They range from 40 to 300 pounds. Bands are used to accommodate resistance for the squat, bench, and deadlift. Even power cleans and snatches are done with bands of light resistance. Chains are used for benching and squatting. The power racks at Westside have holes every 2 inches from the bottom to 2 feet up. There are holes every 1 inch from 2 feet up to the height of the bench press supports, then back to 2 inches apart. These racks are indestructible. This leaves specialty equipment. The first and the simplest is the pulling sled. It is used for GPP. Some lifters will walk up to one mile with 45-90 pounds for strength training, making 60-yard trips. Some use 400 pounds. Westside lifters also push a sled; it’s called a Butcher. It’s great for conditioning.\nNow for the heavy artillery. A glute/ham bench is a must for any serious gym. The one Westside uses is 30 inches wide for maximal hamstring activation. The next machine is a rear builder: the belt squat machine. While it was made for belt squatting, this machine can correct pelvic tilt while building tremendous leg strength. By simulated walking in the belt squat machine one can develop tremendous hips. Walking forward and backward and pushing off to the left and right will build lateral strength and speed for ball sports. An old weightlifting exercise from overseas is to do belt squats while holding kettlebells or a barbell. This is incredible for hip, leg, and low back strength while it tractions the spine.\nThe Plyo Swing is a patented device that is tremendous for strong legs. It can be done for leg pressing with bands and weight. It is primarily used for explosive leg strength. You can also build explosive leg strength by jumping off a platform for a series of 5-10 jumps for 3 or 4 sets. You can do jumps from a relaxed state for individual jumps or rebound jumps for reps. For a bilateral deficit, one leg can be used at a time. Next up is the old standard the Reverse Hyper machine. My first patent was issued in 1994, my second in 2002, my third in 2007, my fourth in 2009, and my last one in December 2010. The Reverse Hyper machine covers a great range of motion. One model has a tilting top, some have a roller system, the strap system came out in 2010, and there’s also a dual-pendulum system. It saved my back from surgery at least twice. The Reverse Hyper machine is done four times a week, twice very heavy, around 600 pounds, and twice at about 50% of your top weight. Westside has four Reverse Hyper machines in the gym, and all four are constantly used by our powerlifters and football players who have weak low backs, which can lead to hamstring pulls. Speaking of hamstring pulls, Westside has an inverse curl machine that will make glute/ham machines obsolete. Now no matter how big you are, you can do a true glute/ham raise much like one does while lying face down on the floor. It has a counter lever device that allows reduction of body weight at the hardest possible angle. The counter to this device is a hip extension quad developer that not only builds the quads and hips but also will increase the range of motion in the hips. Both machines are Westside exclusives. They were designed by Brady Mattingly and patented by Westside Barbell. Of course you must have a lat pull-down machine, deadlift platform with band attachments, dumbbells, and a Monolift. Now you are ready to challenge the world.\nThese are the more innovative ideas that make Westside so strong. How strong? The average top-five squat is 1150 pounds; the average top-five bench press is 882 pounds; and the average top-five deadlift is 848 pounds. This should be proof. Our top-five averages are always going up. Oh by the way, our average top five adds up to 2766. This is what it takes to reach the top and stay there.\nLouie Simmons",

Everyone had an opinion, and of course so do I. I believe it’s the Westside system. Westside had 13 men who have totaled over 2500 pounds, 4 over 2700 pounds, and 2 over 2800 pounds. This is just a taste of what Westside training has done. The common denominator of the success of Westside lifters is pendulum wave periodization.\nFor explosive or speed strength training, a three-week wave is performed. I am amazed at how many people think Westside trains with light weights; not so. The recommended bar speed is 0.8 m/s. I have mentioned countless times that we train at 50-60% of a contest max for squatting, but also have stated that we train the box squat at parallel. If you were only box squatting, the training percents would be at 75-85% of that box record. I hope this makes it clear. Now back to a contest max.\nWhile training on a box, the barbell weight should be 50-60% and the band tension should be 25% at the top of the lift. Let’s analyze with band shrinkage. The weight plus band tension on the first week at 50% for a 1000-pound squatter (which we have had 17) is 600 pounds on the box and 750 pounds at the top of the squat. The second week at 55% would amount to 650 pounds at the box level and 800 pound at the top of the squat. The third week of the wave, the barbell weight is 600 pounds plus 100 pounds of band tension on the box and 850 pounds at the top of the squat. This means the combination of bar weight plus band tension for weeks 1-3 is as follows.\nWeek 1: 60-75% at the top\nWeek 2: 65-80% at the top\nWeek 3: 70-85% at the top\nThis wave is intended to develop speed strength. Research on 780 highly qualified weightlifters who were training during the two pre-contest months concluded that 50% of the weights lifted in the snatch and clean/jerk should be at 75-85% of a one-rep max. This research was done by A. D. Ermakov and N. S. Atanasova in 1975. Their results can be found in the book Managing the Training of the Weightlifters. This text also states that over 50% of the training was special exercises. Westside uses a much higher percent of special exercises–well over 90%.\nFor strength speed, or slow strength, where the bar speed is close to 0.6 m/s, the wave must last only two weeks. Longer than this can lead to severe fatigue or injury. Here, one must use more band tension at the top than bar weight. This will slow the lift considerably. Dr. Fred Hatfield said, “no one can lift a heavy weight slow,” and he was right. World records are lifted slower than training weights, but the ratio in a monthly plan should be roughly 80 lifts at 0.8 m/s and 12 lifts at less than 0.6 m/s, or much slower on max effort day.\nA.J. Roberts recently ran a two-week strength speed wave and made on the first week 385 pounds of bar weight plus 700 pounds of band tension. The second week A.J. made 425 pounds of bar weight plus 700 pounds of band tension. The second week combination adds up to 1125 pounds at the top of the squat. A.J. also has a record on the box with the opposite combination of weights and band tension. A bar weight of 690 pounds and a band tension of 440 pounds is his best. This adds up to 1130 pounds. At the following contest A.J. made an 1140-pound squat, which is a 40-pound increase officially.\nI have talked about two waves that are used on speed day workouts, or Friday, for the squat. All special strengths are trained. This is important for proper restoration for the next extreme workout on Monday, or max effort day. The Friday workout must be high volume with moderate intensity, whereas Monday, or max effort day, is high intensity and low volume. The speed workout plan for speed strength is to return to 50% of a one-rep max and also to change the bar or stance or the amount of band tension or change to chain weight for accommodation. The chains will not add to an increase in kinetic energy because they will not help force your eccentric phase, as bands do, aiding in stored reversal energy. The key to strength increase is to move the same percentage of a one-rep max at a different speed. The speed waves must be used with accommodation to help reduce bar deceleration.\nDr. Fred Hatfield opened my eyes in the early 1980s with his theory of compensatory acceleration training (CAT). Dr. Hatfield’s method called upon the athlete to increase muscle tension by trying to move the load as fast as possible throughout the lift. I like to think Westside took it a step further with combinations of resistance methods (CRM). This system is discussed in Supertraining by Mel Siff. Dr. Siff was fascinated by our use of this method while visiting Westside Barbell in 2000. The special strength waves are repeated throughout the year, year in and year out, to maintain a fast rate of force development by changing the amount of band tension or chain weight or by combining both chains and bands. It is also advisable to use two strength bands. Place one over the bar and the other over the plates to cause an abrupt loading effect. It can be effective to place a band over different size plates as well. Every three weeks we know how fast our lifters are on speed day, and every 7 days how strong they are, not like a conventional cycle, which only lets one know his current strength level close to a meet, when it could be too late.\nThe meet training is two methods that intersect with each other: the circa-max phase plus the delayed transformation phase. Five weeks out from a meet, we will de-load some of the volume on Friday, or speed day, for two weeks. Three weeks out we use a circa-max phase the first week. For example our 1160-, 1150-, and 1140-pound squatters work up to 690-720 pounds of bar weight plus 440 pounds of band tension on a box. Two weeks out they drop down to 510 bar weight plus 440 pounds of band tension for 1 rep. During week 3 they wear their Inzer Predator and Leviathan suits with the straps down and no knee wraps. Two weeks out, the 510 pounds of bar weight plus 440 pounds of band tension is done for 1 rep with just Predators. One week out the heavyweight lifters will do only special exercises, such as the Reverse Hyper machine, glute/ham raises, and pulling a weight sled. The lightweights will work up to 330 pounds of bar weight plus 140 pounds of band tension with no gear on a parallel box, plus light special exercises due to making weight. This is how we use wave periodization.\nThere are many plans to follow, such as the models that Dr. Tudor Bompa prescribed and Medvedev’s 1964 wave-like scheme, which I modified. Dr. Verkhoshansky, whom I admired greatly, used a longer block style system with long-term delayed transformation. This last style I found somewhat less predictable, but you must have a plan or you plan to fail.\nTo the wave style by Medvedev, I added the pendulum approach by Arosiev and others to form my Westside system. Vasily Alexeyev, a very famous Olympic lifter, used the same system that I discovered in 1983. Dr. Mel Siff related this to me when he visited Westside and asked how I came up with this model. I told him that after three weeks of training with the same exercises, I did not get any stronger, nor did I get any faster, and would see a detraining effect on the fourth week. So I started the three-week pendulum wave system. Dr. Siff reflected that Alexeyev said the same thing. That was good enough for me.\nA 1100+ squatter’s three-week wave would look like this for the final wave for speed strength before a major reduction in training volume for a deloading phase for two weeks.\nWeek 1: 600 x 2 reps, 8 sets, plus 250 pounds of band tension at the top Total volume = 13,600\nWeek 2: 650 x 2 reps, 8 sets, plus 250 pounds of band tension at the top Total volume = 14,400\nWeek 3: 700 x 2 reps, 8 sets, plus 250 pounds of band tension at the top Total volume = 15,200\nThis is the amount of volume on speed day that an 1100-pound squatter must be able to handle to not only make such a squat on meet day but also endure the training for the bench press and deadlift to succeed as well. There are many reasons why we have so many large totals and individual lifts, and it’s not by lifting light weights. As Dr. Squat once said, “if light weights make you strong, then why not just train with light weights?” Of course they don’t, and Westside knows that. If you’ve never been to Westside, you have no idea of what goes on inside the walls, but hopefully you will research us and reach your true potential.\nLouie Simmons",

I personally realized in the early 1970s that my quads were somewhat smaller than before I started doing box squats. Of course I Olympic lifted first and used a close stance with a raised heel. But box squatting with a wide stance while pushing the knees out to the sides placed most of the work on the hips and glutes. It was at this point that I started to belt squat, including standing on a ramp and not locking out the legs to keep tension on the quads.\nWestside lifters would belt squat after box squatting or on max effort day after a good morning or a deadlift of some type. Today, we use several variations of the belt squat. Variation include belt squatting on a box; belt squatting without a box; walking on the belt squat platform until failure; walking forward where the cable is behind you, bent over like deadlifting (this is an unreal glute developer); and walking backward with tension on the front of the legs. We also do a lot of calf work in the belt squat machine. Download Your Manual Today Your variants will appear here Buy Now Incredibly Strong Hamstrings Next up is the calf ham/glute bench. You must have incredibly strong hamstrings for squatting, deadlifting, and of course running. The reps can be very high, up to 60, for conditioning or 2-6 for strength with weight. Our glute/ham bench is 34 inches wide, so we can hit the entire hamstring. Raising the foot plate will make it much harder, for added development. For the advanced, use one leg at a time.\nBand leg curls are frequently done to thicken the ligaments and tendons. Ten- or 20-pound ankle weights for up to 200 reps will also thicken the soft tissue to prevent injuries. Kinetic energy can be increased by thickening the ligaments and tendons, which will help reversal strength. Switching specialty bars on max effort day will cause added growth and strength development by causing extra stimulation by not allowing you to master the bar. Front squats, the Safety Squat bar, a 14-inch cambered bar, and even the Zercher harness will make it possible for new physical development, due to learning a new task. Using bands and chains to create accommodation to cause max tension throughout the entire range of motion can do amazing things to one’s muscle. Westside was the first to introduce chains, then bands to barbells, and now every commercial has a football player doing something with chains or bands attached to the bar.\nNext up is the Plyo Swing. Ours is much like the one shown in the Science and Practice of Strength Training by Vlad Zatsiorsky. We attach bands to the machine first to accommodate resistance and second to increase kinetic energy, causing an overspeed eccentric phase. We also do lots of leg pressing with light weight for high reps, up to 75, or low reps with very heavy weight. It’s important to do one leg at a time to eliminate a bilateral deficit, which almost everyone possesses. Walk With A Sled This brings us to power walking with a weight sled. About 1994, I was wondering why the Finns were so good at deadlifting. Of course they were very athletic, but was that the only reason? I doubt it. My good friend Eskil Thomasson from Sweden was staying here with us. He was going back to Sweden for a visit before moving to Westside for 10 years. When he went to Finland, he asked why they were all great deadlifters. To his surprise they had no idea. Some were lumberjacks and would pull the logs out to the road for the tractor to pick them up. They used several ways to pull the logs. One way was to pull them backwards; some would walk forward; some would pull over the shoulder. All and all, the key was heavy manual labor, but it added up to a lot of log pulling. On hearing this, I started pulling a tire at first and then sleds, very heavy at times, around 450 pounds for 100 feet for three or four trips. Using 225 pounds for six trips of 60 yards works great for powerlifters, sprinters, and football players. It is done three times a week, weather permitting. The heaviest pulling is on Monday. For strength development, reduce the load about one-third on Wednesday for strength endurance, and on Friday, use a 45-pound plate or two for a warmup or restoration. Sled power-walking will build all the muscles in the lower body while increasing your conditioning at the same time. Don’t forget, you can work your upper body as well by using a second strap. You can do any movement you want, such as curls, upright rows, triceps extensions, pec work, you name it. Kids of 10 years old and up can use a sled. Add Resistance For a more intense workout, add ankle weights, weight vests, or both for added resistance. For extra hamstring work, walk with the straps between your legs and lower them to knee level. Walk with as large a step as possible, or they can be done like pull-throughs. Just switch styles as often as you like to keep new stimulation of the lower or upper body. One of my favorite exercises is good mornings with the sled. Use a neck harness attached to the sled strap, walk backwards slowly, bend over, and methodically stand erect, then walk backwards with tension at all times. This will blow up the back like nothing else. Note: you don’t need very heavy weight for this to be effective.\nPhil Harrington has broken several world records in the squat. His best is 905 pounds in the 181-pound class, before Mike Cartinian raised it to 930 pounds lifting for Big Iron. Phil set a goal to break Tony Fratto’s raw record at 198 set in 1972, 749 pounds, and in March 2011 Phil did 755 pounds. He was concentrating on jumping exercises of all types and not doing a lot of squatting. Here is a list of jumping exercises Phil used to break the raw squat record. First, to prepare himself for jumping, he started by doing presses with a barbell and dumbbells while sitting on the floor. They are used to condition all muscles involved in jumping. First while on his knees, he did several repetitions of jumping to his feet. Next, Phil added a barbell on his back while jumping to his feet. Then, he did the following over several weeks. First, he held a bar on his thighs while kneeling and jumped to a power clean. Next, from a kneeling position with the bar on his thighs, he jumped into a power snatch. After mastering the mentioned movements, he held a bar on his thighs and jumped into a split clean and then split snatch. After this, he set records in the kneeling squat up onto a box or from a kneeling position into a long jump. These jumps build explosive power. For strength, jump onto boxes with ankle weights or a weight vest. Hold dumbbells and jump onto boxes for record heights with a certain amount of weight or combinations of weight. Switch the resistance often and do 10-30 jumps per workout. Two or three jump workouts a week works well. About once every month try a body weight jump record. This may look like a sports workout, but it will serve to condition a lifter as well as making his legs very explosive.\nThis is just a small sample of workouts you can do. Don’t overdo it. You must raise your GPP to recover from your high-volume or high-intensity workout. Phil proved it works, and Laura Phelps is experimenting with jumps as well. Do easy jumping as a warmup or come back to the gym later for a more intense workout and watch your squats and pulls go up.

THE DEADLIFT Louie Simmons Thu Oct 13, 2016 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/Louie-Simmons-Weightlifting_9afefd9c-ddfc-4da5-8f9f-de6fdd140df1_720x.jpg?v=1563691391\" width=\"300\" height=\"348\" alt=\"TOP FIVE: PART III. THE DEADLIFT\"> Related Topics: Deadlift, Exercise Programming, Louie Simmons, Strength Training Methods, Strength Training Program Before bench shirts, there was a saying, “the meet does not start until the bar touches the floor”. At Westside, we have always had very good deadlifters: 18 at 800 pounds or more; the top five average 845 pounds. How does Westside train the deadlift and the squat without them interfering with each other? How can the deadlift be kept explosive? These are two questions that are asked over and over. Here are the answers to both. The speed pulls are done on Friday after squatting. Squats are done for speed strength development 90% of the time. Multiple sets are done on a box with a combination of weights, bands, or chains for accommodating resistance. About 50% of the time speed deadlifts are done after squatting. There are two methods that we alternate. Speed pulls can be done in the rack with a conventional stance. The plates are 2, 4, or 6 inches off the floor. We double up mini-bands for up to a 500-pound deadlift. The monster mini or light bands are doubled up as well. Monster minis yield about 250 pounds at lockout. The light bands add 350 pounds at lockout.\nFor building speed strength, 6-10 singles are done using a three-week wave, adding some weight each week. When doing speed work off the floor, use a wide sumo stance, wider than normal, to build the hips. Two bands are used. Mini-bands on our platform will provide 220 pounds of tension at the top. This works well for those who deadlift up to 750 pounds. For lifters approaching 800 pounds, monster mini-bands add 280 pounds at lockout. Six to 10 singles work well after speed squatting. After squatting and speed pulls, work the low back and hamstrings as hard as possible depending on your level of preparedness. Glute/ham raises, Reverse Hyper machine, light good mornings for high reps with emphasis on the hamstrings, and power sled walking off the heels are a few to rotate from. Ab exercises are of the utmost importance: straight leg sit-ups, leg raises lying down or hanging, static ab work using a lat bar doing straight arm push downs, and side bends. Follow ab work by lat work: pull-downs (put chains on the bars often), chest-supported rows, low-pulley rows, dumbbell and barbell rows. Pick a total of three or four special exercises after squatting and speed pulls. Rotate the exercises after two or three workouts as a rule. Also change the sets and reps to avoid accommodation by changing the amount of volume and the intensity. This will help restoration.\nMax Effort Day An extreme workout can occur every 72 hours. Speed squats and pulls are done on Friday. This means Monday is max effort day. How do we train the squat and deadlift maximally? A squat will build a deadlift, and a deadlift will build a squat. The good morning and its many varieties will build both. The body will respond to the demands placed upon it. This describes the max effort method. This is explained in many texts, such as The Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. M. Zatsiorsky, 1995.\nFor squatting and deadlifting, work up to a max single. The good mornings are done for a max of 3 or 5 reps. The good mornings will build strength endurance in the back and legs. Otherwise a max on that day should be 1 rep. There is no particular order to follow, but one week do one type of deadlift, the next week a squat of some kind, then the following week a good morning. If you have limited equipment, do light good mornings after a max squat or deadlift. Exercises after a max effort workout could be any of the following: Back raises\nPulling a sled\n45-degree back raises\nLat pull-downs\nReverse Hyper machine\nChest-supported rows\nBelt squats\nBarbell rows\nDumbbell rows\nUpright rows\nAb work of all kinds If possible, do a small second workout with lighter special exercises or do a flexibility workout or some type of restoration such as hot tub, sauna, ice, massage, or chiropractic. Let’s look at a random program for max effort.\nFirst Week Safety squat bar, 10-inch box to a max single\nSix trips of 60 yards with a heavy sled\nLat work of your choice\nHamstring exercise (e.g., glute/ham raises)\nReverse Hyper machine and abs for at least 4 sets each Second Week Rack pulls on pins 3-6 inches off the ground with plates\nMax single, conventional stance\nBelt squats. Work up to heavy sets of 5 reps or more depending on your work capacity.\nChest-supported rows\nLow-pulley rows\n45-degree back raises for high reps, 6 to 10 reps with weights\nReverse Hyper machine and abs for at least 4 sets each Third Week Zercher squats as low as possible. If you cannot lift the bar off the floor, place it on power rack pins or place plates on rubber mats.\nFront squat off of a low box, 10 to 12 inches, for sets of 6 reps. For those who cannot hold a front squat position or hold a heavy bar in your elbows, Westside offers a Zercher harness.\nHeavy upright rows, with a barbell or dumbbells\nReverse Hyper machine and abs, at least 4 sets each Fourth Week\nWhen needed, do not do a barbell exercise, but do high-rep exercises for the upper back, lower back, abs, and hamstrings, or just take it very easy with an active rest workout consisting of walking with a light sled or perhaps walking with a weight vest and ankle weights. Depending on your level of fitness, walk for a half mile up to two miles.\nRemember, this workout is for restoration, so do not overdo it. I personally get more muscle stimulation in a directed area, meaning lower back or hamstrings or even my abs. This is done to suit my personality, which is also probably much like most readers. At least do flexibility or mobility work. Also roll on foam rollers or a lacrosse ball. Go to www.ampedwarmup.com or Kelly Starrett at www.sanfranciscocrossfit.com. Kelly is knowledgeable in this field.\nFifth Week Ultra-wide stiff-leg sumo to a max single.\nLeg press, close stance or wide stance\nHeavy shrugs. We use a strongman wheel barrow known as a Wheel Farrow.\nLat pull-downs\nReverse Hyper machine and abs for at least 4 sets each Sixth Week Bent-leg, bent-back good mornings\nHeavy sled work for 8 trips of 100 feet. Stay on heels.\nChest-supported rows\nLow-pulley rows\nGlute/ham raises\nReverse Hyper machine and abs for at least 4 sets each Seventh Week Front squat to a max single. Work down doing reps at two or three weights. There are two varieties to use, a close stance on a low box or a wide stance much like your sumo deadlift stance. This teaches body mechanics for both the squat and deadlift.\n45-degree back raises with as heavy a weight as possible for 5 reps\nLow-pulley rows\nClose grip lat pull-downs\nReverse Hyper machine and straight leg sit-ups for at least 4 sets each Eighth Week Heavy sled walking, meaning 4-6 plates or more. Walk 60 yards and make no less than 6 trips and no more than 10. During the week the heavy sled work was done on Monday, or max effort day. On Wednesday drop weight from five plates to three plates for example. On Friday, drop the weight again from three plates to one 45-pound plate or 70 pounds for a warm-up for speed squatting day.\nAfter the max effort sled day, do lat pull-downs\nGlute/ham raises\nReverse Hyper machine and abs for at least 4 sets each Ninth Week\nRack pulls with a conventional stance with two band tensions, one with 250 pounds at the top with monster mini-bands and the second with light bands, which provide 350 pounds at the top. For example, my deadlift is around 700 pounds. My best with 250 pounds of band tension is 515 pounds. My best with 350 pounds of band tension is 415. Both are estimated to be 765 pounds at lockout, the same as my current pin 3 record. The plates are 6 inches off the floor.\nAfter rack pulls, do belt squats or leg press. Reverse Hyper machine and ab work must follow, at least 4 sets each. Rack pulls with bands are very stressful, and the special exercises must be held to a minimum.\nTenth Week\nDo concentric good mornings or squat. Crawl under the bar, relax, then lift concentrically. This is a tester, while some other special exercises are builders. Paul Anderson performed a lot of squatting and pressing with no eccentric actions. To follow-up, you must do either sled pulling or belt squatting or leg pressing. Then do direct low-back work with back raises or the Reverse Hyper machine, and add some lat work and heavy abs and you’re done.\nThese workouts can be done in any sequence. There are countless other workouts to do. You will find which ones work best for you. Do these workouts work?\nAs I started this three-part series, our average top five squat was 1143 pounds, now it is 1151 pounds plus a sixth 1100+ squat of 1115 at 266 pounds. Our bench top five average was 851 pounds, now it is 861 pounds. Westside’s Dave “Neutron” Hoff made a 2805-pound world record in the 275-pound weight class. A. J. Roberts made a 2825 world record in the 308-pound weight class. The average top five total was 2690 and is now 2725 pounds.\nYes it works; there is much more to the Westside system. On March 5, 2011, two former Westside members made historic world records. Phil Harrington made a 755 raw squat at 198 pounds, breaking Tony Fratto’s record of 749 in 1972, and Chuck Vogelpohl made an 1180-pound squat in the 275 pound weight class, 24 years after winning his first national championship.

      "pageContent": "TOP FIVE: PART II. THE BENCH Louie Simmons Thu Oct 13, 2016 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/Louie-Simmons-Weightlifting_bbaa1596-ade7-41f7-a231-4a12de9fcef0_720x.jpg?v=1563691115\" width=\"300\" height=\"348\" alt=\"TOP FIVE: PART II. THE BENCH\"> Related Topics: Bench, Exercise Programming, Louie Simmons, Strength Training Methods, Strength Training Program I wrote an article in 1993 entitled “Three of a Kind”. Westside was the only gym to have three 600-pound benchers: Kenny Patterson, George Halbert, and Jerry Obradovich. Things have changed since then. Today Westside has developed 32 men who have benched over 700 pounds, and a 525-pound bench by a 165-pound female, Laura Phelps. We also have five who bench over 800 pounds, with Dave Hoff at 900 pounds at 257 body weight with a 2770 total. The top five average 852 pounds. All of these lifts were performed by members who have gym bags, not visitors with suitcases. But how? Just like our squats, there is a plan we must follow. It has three parts, consisting of biomechanics, physics, and mathematics. There can be no guesswork, but rather a calculated long-term plan. The speed day is somewhat different from squatting due to the fact that we never use any supportive gear on speed day. The weekend is devoted to speed development only. The bar is very light, around 40% to 50% of a 1-rep max at the chest, while the use of chains or bands raise the top weight to around 60% through accommodating resistance. This is essential, as it builds the ability to display a fast rate of force development. It also will perfect form. For the best results use three grips: the index finger on the smooth, the index finger two inches out from the smooth, and the pinkie finger on the power ring. This ensures extra triceps work in the workout. Nine sets of 3 reps work great during contest training. When you are not training for a meet, 12-16 sets of 3 reps can be done. This will build muscle mass by raising the total volume while maintaining the same intensity zone for speed benching. For those who raw bench 300 pounds, one set of 5/8-inch chains or a set of mini-bands will provide accommodating resistance. For those who bench 400 pounds raw, two sets of 5/8-inch chains are used. We have lots of 500-pound raw bench pressers, and they use up to three sets of 5/8-inch chains or a mini-band that yields 85 pounds at the lockout. A combination of chains and band tension can be used. Many use chains with choked bands to give an abrupt load at the top end of the bench. An alternative to bands or chains is to hang a kettlebell on the bar with a mini-band; this causes an erratic bar path, which improves stability.\nBelow is outlined several three-week waves. You will note the weight does not change but rather the combinations of accommodating resistance.\n300 Raw Bench Max Week\nBar Weight\nSets\nReps\nAccommodating Resistance 1\n150 pounds\n9\n3\nMini-bands, 85 pounds band tension 2\n150 pounds\n9\n3\nMini-bands, 85 pounds band tension 3\n150 pounds\n9\n3\nMini-bands, 85 pounds band tension Week\nBar Weight\nSets\nReps\nAccommodating Resistance 1\n150 pounds\n9\n3\n2 sets of chains, 80 pounds band tension 2\n150 pounds\n9\n3\n2 sets of chains, 80 pounds band tension 3\n150 pounds\n9\n3\n2 sets of chains, 80 pounds band tension Week\nBar Weight\nSets\nReps\nAccommodating Resistance 1\n150 pounds\n9\n3\n2 sets of chains, choked with a mini-band 2\n150 pounds\n9\n3\n2 sets of chains, choked with a mini-band 3\n150 pounds\n9\n3\n2 sets of chains, choked with a mini-band Note: Two sets of chains loaded correctly is approximately 60 pounds at lockout plus the choked mini-band gives 25 pounds.

If you are getting stronger, a light to heavier wave will work. If you are looking to get a faster, go heaviest the first week and reduce the accommodating resistance each week.\nWe use an assortment of specialty bars to do speed work with. A bow bar that is 2 inches thick and has a 2-inch camber provides a 2 inch longer range of motion.\nUsing a cambered bar builds not only a stronger start but also a stronger lockout due to pressing an extra 2 inches. A 3-inch cambered bar is also used. A football bar is used that has three different grips to choose from. A T-grip barbell is very popular at Westside. It has a neutral grip that works the triceps very hard. A bench bar that is 2 3/8 inches thick, such as a Mastodon squat bar, is commonly used for the dynamic day. By using different bars your body must constantly adjust to a new stimulus. The bars are used on max effort day as well.\nThere is no circa-max phase at Westside for benching. The reason is simple: no supportive gear is used on this day. When people fail doing this system, it is always due to training too heavy on speed day, which leads to a decrease in performance on max effort day. After the speed day workout, we suggest you do two sets of dumbbell presses. Use a weight you can do a fairly easy set of 15 reps with or 2 sets of 15 reps with a barbell. Do one set ultra-wide with a grip 1 inch outside the ring and one set close grip. A 500-pound raw bencher would use 205 or 225 pounds. A third alternative would be 2 sets of push-ups for high reps, around 25-50. Then move on to triceps extensions (roll-backs or elbows out to the sides) and dumbbell rows.\nWestside does a lot of barbell extensions. The dumbbell extensions are done for 8-12 reps for 6-8 sets on average. Next up are lats: chest-supported rows, T-bar rows, barbell or dumbbell rows, or lat pull-downs with several different bars, with close or wide grips, for 4-12 sets of 10 reps on average. Some shrugs and a few hammer curls and you are done.\nMax Effort\nA max effort workout is done three days later, which for us is Wednesday. We do just what it sounds like: we max out but try not to miss. Each week we rotate a barbell exercise. Why? When doing the same barbell exercise for three weeks in a row, you will have a decrease in performance. This is accommodation. Most athletes will change their training program each year, but we found that a better system is to switch a barbell exercise each week. Strength is measured in time, due to the work, not the amount of weight being lifted. Each special strength has its own velocity that you must understand in order to develop it. The max effort exercise will move slowly, but it produces a large force.\nLet’s start with a plan for four weeks. Tony Bolognone would use this plan. Tony is an 800-pound bencher. Week 1, work up to a max single in the floor press (his record is 550 pounds); week 2, try a new record with 200 pounds of band tension for a 1-rep max (his record is 425 pounds bar weight plus 200 pounds band tension with no shirt); week 3, do steep incline press with a moderate grip (his record is 490 pounds); week 4, take a record on two boards or one board (just before meets, try a record off one board). What Tony makes on two boards he then benches in a bench shirt.\nA. J. Roberts, who is an 820-pound bencher, does the following. Week 1, use a three-board press with no shirt (his record is 675 pounds); week 2, floor press with 160 pounds of chains (his record is 495 pounds); week 3, seated press off pins at shoulder level (his record is 405 pounds); week 4, use two boards with a shirt (his record is 900 pounds).\nDave Hoff, who is a 900-pound bencher, does the following. Week 1, two boards without a shirt (his record is 615 pounds); week 2, floor press for a 3-rep max (his record is 530 pounds); week 3, board press on two boards (his record is 900 pounds, the same as his best meet bench).\nAs you can see, what the Westside lifters do on two boards, they bench on meet day. They don’t jack up the shirt for boards. This makes it almost impossible to touch the chest when it counts. Also you see they use a shirt about every fourth week. Other cycles could look like this:\nWeek 1: lightened method with 155 pounds off the bottom for a max single\nWeek 2: close grip bench with 120 pounds of chains\nWeek 3: max 6 reps with an illegal grip\nThis is done for three-week waves. This is not intended for max effort work, but for muscle hypertrophy. The volume is much higher for a three-week wave, which can shock the system and is known as shock training. There are other barbell exercises that must occur on max effort day. It does not matter if you are a raw lifter or a shirt lifter. The training is the same with the exception of doing more dumbbell work. Remember, a shirt can give you only so much.\nTravis Bell has raw benched 550 pounds at about 250 pounds body weight. George Halbert raw benches 550 pounds at 198 pounds body weight. The late Nick Winters made a 700-pound raw bench. Many at Westside have at least a 600-pound raw bench. So as you can see, it does not matter raw or shirted. The special exercises are the same on both dynamic day and max effort day with the emphasis on triceps and lats. The rear and side delts are next. Westside lifters use Inzer’s Rage X and Super Phenom for their meets. Remember, use fast benching on one day for high volume, low intensities, and low volume, max intensity on max effort day. Always have the hand-off man lift the bar out over the upper abs, then lower in a straight line and press upward in the same line.\nI hope this helps you reach your fullest potential.\nLouie Simmons",

The top five average 1143 pounds. Our top five totals equal 2690 pounds. How can one gym develop such a strong group? The answer is hard work, coupled with science, experience, and dedication. But what is the system that produced this top five average in the squat? It’s a two-day system. One day is max effort day, which is done on Monday. Three days later, on Friday, we devote to special strength, explosive speed, or strength speed. Let’s look at speed day on Friday.\nHere, we do multiple sets depending on the percentages. For speed strength the percent is 50-60% (based on a contest max) for box squatting in briefs or a suit with the straps down. The sets can vary from 8 to 12. Bands or chains must be used to accommodate resistance to eliminate most of the deceleration phase. For speed strength the band tension is an average of 25% at the top. There is also great tension at the bottom to eliminate momentum. The bar speed should average 0.8 m/s. The rest between sets should be held around 60-90 seconds. The stance should be very wide to utilize the hips, glutes, and hamstrings. You must use the correct box squat form. This means pushing the knees out to the sides to exert force outward. The shins must never come over the toes but should be past vertical to the rear. This causes one to leg-curl off the box. Now, let’s look at a three-week pendulum wave for the development of speed development. Let’s look at Tony Bolognone, who is an 1150-pound squatter. Below is a table showing a three-week wave. Week 1\n10 sets\n2 reps\n575 pounds bar weight\n250 pounds band tension Week 2\n10 sets\n2 reps\n635 pounds bar weight\n250 pounds band tension Week 3\n8 sets\n2 reps\n690 pounds bar weight\n250 pounds band tension A.J. Roberts has an 1100-pound squat. Below is a table showing a typical speed-strength three-week cycle. Week 1\n10 sets\n2 reps\n550 pounds bar weight\n250 pounds band tension Week 2\n10 sets\n2 reps\n605 pounds bar weight\n250 pounds band tension Week 3\n8 sets\n2 reps\n660 pounds bar weight\n250 pounds band tension For both men, the band tension is slightly less than 25%, but at Westside a strong band gives us 250 pounds of tension. Dave Hoff has a 1075-pound squat at 275 bodyweight. Below is a table of a three-week wave with weight and bands together. This is a combination of 160 pounds of chains and 140 pounds of band tension. This is a typical three-week speed-strength wave. Week 1\n10 sets\n2 reps\n540 pounds bar weight\n300 pounds bands + chains Week 2\n10 sets\n2 reps\n600 pounds bar weight\n300 pounds bands + chains Week 3\n10 sets\n2 reps\n660 pounds bar weight\n300 pounds bands + chains The three examples above show a 1075-pound, an 1100-pound, and an 1150-pound squatter. You see, the weights are slightly different per lifter. There can be no hypothetical reasoning. The math must be correct to maintain proper bar speed. This is all based on mathematics. Strength-speed work is also done on Friday. The band tension must be at least 50% of the total squat at the top.\nBelow are two examples of a strength-speed workout by A. J. Roberts using two different combinations of band tension and bar weight. The first strength-speed workout will be with 440 pounds of band tension, working up to a 1 rep max. The work looks like this: 320 pounds bar weight\n2 reps\n440 pounds band tension 420 pounds bar weight\n2 reps\n440 pounds band tension 510 pounds bar weight\n1 rep\n440 pounds band tension 600 pounds bar weight\n1 rep\n440 pounds band tension 660 pounds bar weight\n1 rep\n440 pounds band tension The circa-max workout netted an 1100-pound squat for A. J. A pure strength-speed workout is where the band tension is greater than the amount of bar weight. The strength-speed workout outlined below will produce great strength at low velocity. 160 pounds bar weight\n2 reps\n700 pounds band tension 240 pounds bar weight\n2 reps\n700 pounds band tension 330 pounds bar weight\n1 rep\n700 pounds band tension 380 pounds bar weight\n1 rep\n700 pounds band tension 425 pounds bar weight\n1 rep\n700 pounds band tension You will notice that the top net weight is with two different combinations of band weight. The total is 1100 pounds with 440 pounds of band tension and 660 pounds of bar weight. The second workout was with 700 pounds of bands and 425 pounds of bar weight. This matches with A.J.’s meet squat. Is this a coincidence? No, not at all.\nUsing the circa-max phase, Tony Ramos, made a squat with 470 pounds of bar weight plus 375 pounds of band tension, which equals 845 pounds at the top. Tony has an 810-pound meet squat. I made 585 pounds bar weight plus 375 pounds of band tension. That adds up to 960 pounds. I made a strong 920 pounds. This shows that band tension of 35-45% works well. As your bar squat goes up, of course the bar weight goes up, but the band tension goes down somewhat. Let’s look at the history of Tony Bolognone’s squat progress from 1000 pounds to 1150 pounds. As your squat improves to 1000 pounds, the band tension goes from 375 pounds to 440 pounds. Tony’s squat 600 pounds bar weight + 440 pounds band tension = 1000 pounds\n650 pounds bar weight + 440 pounds band tension = 1050 pounds\n675 pounds bar weight + 440 pounds band tension = 1075 pounds\n690 pounds bar weight + 440 pounds band tension = 1100 pounds\n720 pounds bar weight + 440 pounds band tension = 1120 pounds\n720 pounds bar weight + 440 pounds band tension = 1130 pounds\n720 pounds bar weight + 440 pounds band tension = 1150 pounds As you can see, there is a direct correlation of Tony’s contest squat with the top value of his box squat with the band and weight combinations. I have seen many such results.\nAfter each Friday speed development workout, the lifters use the Reverse Hyper machine and do calf/ham/glute raises, abs, and some kind of lat work. At times, sled power walking, back extensions, good mornings, belt squatting, or light speed pulls can be done. Below is a simple guideline to follow to determine what to expect at meet time based on a box squat record. 800 pounds meet squat\n500 pounds bar weight\n375 pounds band tension 850 pounds meet squat\n550 pounds bar weight\n375 pounds band tension 900 pounds meet squat\n600 pounds bar weight\n375 pounds band tension 950 pounds meet squat\n650 pounds bar weight\n375 pounds band tension 1000 pounds meet squat\n600 pounds bar weight\n440 pounds band tension 1050 pounds meet squat\n650 pounds bar weight\n440 pounds band tension 1100 pounds meet squat\n700 pounds bar weight\n440 pounds band tension 1150 pounds meet squat\n720 pounds bar weight\n440 pounds band tension This will cover most of the population. If you squat 400 to 550 pounds, simply cut the weight and band tension in half. The second workout for the squat also works for the deadlift. Max Effort Day\nThis day is for lifting a max single, the best on that day depending on your level of preparedness. Doing heavy doubles or triples builds strength endurance, so stick to singles. Each week, rotate a special squat, pull, or good morning. There are many special exercises to choose from. This means eventually you will select six to eight lifts to rotate between, not the ones you like, but the ones that work best for raising your squat and deadlift. Below are exercises that Jake Anderson may choose from, depending on which work best for him. All are core lifts. Pin 2 rack pull\nLow-box front squat\nBent-over good mornings\nBand deadlifts with 220 pounds over the bar\nBand deadlifts with 280 pounds over the bar\nZercher lifts\nUltrawide sumo deadlifts\nSafety squat bar\nBox deadlifts 2 inches off the box\nBox deadlifts 4 inches off the box\nRack pulls with 250 pounds of band tension\nRack pulls with 350 pounds of band tension\nConcentric good mornings\n14 inch cambered bar low box squat\nPower cleans or snatches There are countless max effort workouts to rotate between. The max effort day is dedicated to both the squat and deadlift. Just as Jake has learned that some work better than others, you will also learn not only what special exercises will build your strength but also what exercises will tell you how strong you are without doing a real squat or deadlift.\nEveryone knows Westside always does box squats. Remember, the box height should be parallel. You must release your hip muscles while sitting on the box. The rest of your body must remain tense. While on the box your chins must be at least straight up and down, or the knees slightly behind the ankles. This overloads the hamstrings and glutes. Always push the knees out to the sides as you lower and rise from the bottom of the squat. A simple tip is to raise the big toe. The best shoe is Chuck Taylors. Actually, the best shoe is no shoe. Specialty Bars Only use a squat bar on speed-strength day. This is the only way to perfect technique. Other bars should be used only if an injury prevents you from using a squat bar. Remember, use three-week waves for speed-strength work and two-week waves for strength-speed work, and for speed work use some accommodating resistance through the use of bands or chains.\nMax effort day exercises must be rotated each week. Small exercises such as lat work of all kinds, lower back, abs, and hamstrings should be rotated when necessary. Check out our DVDs, books, or articles for more information.\nLouie Simmons",

The two max effort workouts are done at least 80% of the year. The remainder of the year, they are replaced by high-volume hypertrophy days aimed at increasing strength in lagging muscle groups. A speed bench workout can account for 12,000 pounds, not counting special exercises. A squat speed day can be 10,000-12,000 pounds plus special exercises. One reason we use a three-week pendulum wave is for speed benching. We use a rotational system of change. Exercises that accommodate resistance are changed every two or three weeks, i.e., bands, chains, weight releasers, or the lightened method. Close, wide, and medium grips are constantly interchanged, as well as the special exercise with barbells or dumbbells. The volume must fluctuate as well. We change the strength curve by using different board loading, and of course on max effort day, we constantly change the barbell lifts. This enables us to break a record almost 100% of the time. Our lifters have the opportunity to set new standards each week whether using no gear, light gear, or our best and strongest gear. The squat is structured in the same manner. Different exercises, different bars, and changing stances and gear are ways to avoid accommodation. For the deadlift, changing your stance from conventional to sumo, ultra-wide, or very close will help with restoration. Do rack pulls on different pins or standing on a 2- or 4-inch box, and always change special exercises.\nPeople are afraid of change, but what got you where you are may not get you where you want to be. But what about conditioning, or GPP (general physical preparedness)? Westside uses numerous special means for recovery, for example, water therapy (both cold and hot), saunas, infrared, steam, chiropractic, ART, eating correctly, and using supplements. I highly recommend my favorite supplements: Musclepharm and Atlarge Nutrition.\nNow let’s get to small workouts for the upper body. I prefer traction while stretching. Indian clubs are ancient but still work great. They were used by wrestlers in India. They were later called fitness clubs because they were popular in early fitness establishments. There are many ways to swing them, i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise, over the head, swinging them in front of the body in a centrifugal force fashion, or one over the head while one is held across in front of the body. The methods are countless. They are great for your grip and rotators. Every movement tractions the wrists, elbows, and shoulders. We also use a mace. It is a very large, very heavy, and long Indian club. There are many varieties of motion, much like swinging a baseball bat.\nA second traction and grip developer as well a prehab and rehab device is battling ropes and chains. John Brookfield popularized them a few years ago, and they caught on with MMA, then football, and now Westside. I had a shoulder socket replacement, and when I started using the ropes, I found it made my shoulders feel great. I started with a 50 foot 1 ½ inch rope and then starting using a 2-inch rope to make it a harder workout. I use a moderate tempo for rehab and prehab. I have used a 2-inch rope for an hour straight. I then bought a half-inch chain to battle with and do a lot of 10-15-minute intervals. It does wonders for my shoulders as well as my conditioning. At 63 years old, I must do several small workouts per week to keep up with my Westside teammates. I think everyone should do them on a regular basis. Like Indian clubs, they traction the wrists, elbows, and shoulders, and traction is the key to longevity. Speaking of traction, Jump-Stretch Flexbands are seen all the time on ESPN football and baseball fields and on the basketball courts. Dick Hartzell is the founder of Jump-Stretch Flexbands. This band system is used everywhere he goes, and he goes everywhere. I thank Dick every day when we put bands on the bar with weights. They have turned Westside into a very dominant power gym.\nThen there’s the bandbell bar. Tony Ramos, Westside’s 181 and 198 pounds lifter, came up with the concept of hanging kettlebells on a bar with mini-bands. After the initial concept, Jim Seitzer, a long-time Westsider, developed a bar that vibrates. I used this bar to bench 300 pounds in a T-shirt three months after shoulder socket replacement. Did you hear that doctors?\nAnother excellent upper body GPP workout is upper body sled work. Whatever you can do with a dumbbell, you can do with a sled and upper body strap, such as curls, extensions, upright rows, pecs, and external rotation work. Get fit and strong at the same time with sled work.\nWhat about lower body workouts? Well, let’s start with sled work for the lower body. There are two methods. The first is for the development of the posterior chain. Here, one walks with a long stride on the heels. After touching the heel, pull through immediately on each touch. This builds the glutes, hips, hamstrings, and calves. This will increase your squat or deadlift immediately. There is no pressure on the spine. A side note: the abs are used on each step. For running or sprinting, it will eliminate deceleration to a large degree. The second method is to stay on the balls of the feet. This is similar to the pose method by Dr. Nicholas Romanov, which teaches you to reduce recovery time. The trip length can vary from 60 yards for power sports to long distance, up to 3 miles for a marathon runner. Try walking backward for knee rehab and thigh development. A powerlifter should do no less than six trips of 60 yards to a maximum of 12 trips for rehab and restoration. Other varieties are walking sideways, or forward with straps held below knee level for hamstrings. Light belt squats can take the stress off the spine while still increasing leg strength. Use both wide and close stances for sled work.\nDon’t forget that glute/ham raises are amazing for restoration. In the former Soviet Union, 600 glute/ham raises were done a month as maintenance. That amounts to 20 per day. That’s doable, right? The glute/ham raises can be rotated with Jump-Stretch Flexband leg curls. For a fast small workout for the entire body try box squatting for 5 minutes without replacing the bar in the rack. It does not matter how many reps you do in the 5 minutes as long as you finish with a squat. Also try doing light deadlifts for 5 minutes without resting the bar on the ground. The Olympic lifts can also be done in the same fashion. This method of training is common for grapplers as well as the great Olympic and world weightlifting champion V. Alexeyev, the first man to clean 500 pounds, which he did in 1970 in Columbus, Ohio.\nThere are too many workouts to mention in one sitting, but make up your own small workouts lasting as little as 20 minutes up to 45 minutes on average. By doing the right amount of small workouts for strength, endurance, and prehab, you can eliminate rehab as well as soreness and a lagging muscle group. For a powerlifter, it depends on your level of strength how many extra workouts a week you do. For a beginner, I found two extra small workouts works best, one for the bench and one for the squat and deadlift. At an advanced level, four works well, two for the upper body, benching muscle groups and two for the low back, hamstrings, and hips. I don’t consider abs work a workout because it is a necessity and can be done several times per week. The same goes for stretching. You must maintain your flexibility. It can be difficult when you gain mass with years of heavy resistance training. One must be in excellent shape to make excellent totals. America is getting fatter by the day. You are an athlete, so look like it and you will perform better. Everyone must get plenty of rest to do their best. Eight hours of sleep is a must. And last but not least, learn to relax and yet be motivated.\nI like to read a good book on occasion, like Call of the Wild, or watch a motivational movie. My favorite movie is Shogun Assassin. In the movie, the Shogun sends his henchman to kill his assassin, who he now fears will kill him, but the henchman kills the assassin’s wife instead but spars their child, Daigoro. As the shogun assassin finds the wife and child, bloody, the wife says “my bad dream has come true” and wipes blood on Daigoro’s face as she dies. Later, the assassin sits Daigoro in front of him with a pretty ball on one side and a sword on the other. He tells the young Daigoro that if he chooses the ball, he will join his mother in death, but if he chooses the sword, he will join him on a road of vengeance. After a moment Daigoro chooses the sword, and indeed he travels a bloody road of vengeance.\nThis is the Westside way. If you choose the ball, you’re done, but if you choose the sword, you will be on the road called kickin’ ass.\nLouie Simmons",

S. Medvedyev wrote a text called A System of Multi-Year Training in Weightlifting (1986). It was translated by Andrew Charniga, Jr. It presents a system to train for and compete in the Olympics. Of course there is much information about training of all respects and how to achieve results at the correct time in a long-term plan. Someone once said, “When you fail to plan, you plan to fail.”\nAnother highly esteemed sports scientist, Tudor Bompa, wrote several books on all subject matter including long-term periodization. In Bompa’s book entitled Theory and Methodology of Training (1997), he discusses training of many lengths of time. The Greek Philostratus, an ancient scholar, proposed a four-day system, referred to as the Teter system. Men such as Tudor Bompa, A. S. Medvedyev, and the late Y. V. Verkoshansky and others such as the Bulgarians Felix Meerson and Hiden had much to do with the short- and long-term planning of the Bulgarian weight training system (Enver Turkileri, 1997). Long-term planning must also address not only adaption but also restoration and how to avoid accommodation. If you read the book Adaption in Sports Training, a weekly plan turns into a monthly and then a yearly plan and of course a multiple-year plan. By 1983, I had been participating in powerlifting for 27 years, but I had no formal plan; my plans or dreams turned into mostly nightmares. I realized that the key to success was part physics, part biomechanics, and very importantly mathematics. Here, I present a long-term plan that has passed the test of time. Dave “Neutron” Hoff has used this plan since he was 14 years old with a 400-pound squat. At 19 years old he had a 1005-pound squat. Now at 22 years old, he has a 1075-pound squat and a total of 2750 pounds at 260 bodyweight. All of my methodologies came from the former Soviet Union system and their highly respected sports scientists and coaches. The strongest lifters lift the heaviest weight most often. I don’t mean lifting 20 pounds heavier than their training partners on max effort day, but on the dynamic day. Many people with a small grasp of training can’t understand this. But this is simply math, as outlined below. For speed strength the combination is 50-60% barbell weight, plus 25% band tension at the top. I based this on 1000-pound squatters; we have 16 in all. A 1000-pound squatter would use 500, 550, and 600 in a three-week wave with 250 pounds of band tension at the top and 100 pounds at the bottom due to band shrinkage. So 500 pounds of bar weight is 600 pounds in the bottom and 750 pounds at the top. The second week 550 pounds of bar weight is 650 pounds in the bottom and 800 pounds at the top, and the third week wave is 600 pounds of bar weight, which is 750 pounds in the bottom and 850 pounds at the top. This is truly accommodation. But the most important point I will be making is for every 50-pound increase, a jump in volume of 600 pounds must be made. Of course on max effort day you must max out at the current strength you are at, plus have good form and train your weaknesses. But let’s look at the mathematical program that will guide you.\nThe Plan: From a 400 to a 1000-Pound Squat\n400-Pound Max Squat percentage\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n200\n12×2\n24\n25%\n4800 55%\n220\n12×2\n24\n25%\n5280 60%\n240\n10×2\n20\n25%\n480 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 450-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n225\n12×2\n24\n25%\n5400 55%\n250\n12×2\n24\n25%\n6000 60%\n270\n10×2\n20\n25%\n5400 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 500-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n250\n12×2\n24\n25%\n6000 55%\n275\n12×2\n24\n25%\n6600 60%\n300\n10×2\n20\n25%\n6000 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 550-Pound Max Squat percent\nWeight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n275\n12×2\n24\n25%\n6600 55%\n300\n12×2\n24\n25%\n7200 60%\n330\n10×2\n20\n25%\n6 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 600-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n300\n12×2\n24\n25%\n7200 55%\n330\n12×2\n24\n25%\n7920 60%\n360\n10×2\n20\n25%\n7200 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 650-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n325\n12×2\n24\n25%\n7800 55%\n355\n12×2\n24\n25%\n8520 60%\n390\n10×2\n20\n25%\n7800 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 700-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n350\n12×2\n24\n25%\n8400 55%\n385\n12×2\n24\n25%\n9240 60%\n420\n10×2\n20\n25%\n8400 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 750-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n375\n12×2\n24\n25%\n9000 55%\n425\n12×2\n24\n25%\n10,200 60%\n450\n10×2\n20\n25%\n9000 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 800-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n400\n12×2\n24\n25%\n9600 55%\n440\n12×2\n24\n25%\n10,560 60%\n480\n10×2\n20\n25%\n9600 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 850-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n425\n12×2\n24\n25%\n10,200 55%\n470\n12×2\n24\n25%\n11,280 60%\n510\n10×2\n20\n25%\n10,200 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 900-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n450\n12×2\n24\n25%\n10,800 55%\n495\n12×2\n24\n25%\n11,880 60%\n540\n10×2\n20\n25%\n10,800 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 950-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n475\n12×2\n24\n25%\n11,400 55%\n520\n12×2\n24\n25%\n12,480 60%\n570\n10×2\n20\n25%\n11,400 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg 1000-Pound Max Squat percent\nweight (pounds)\nreps\nlifts\nband tension\nvolume 50%\n500\n12×2\n24\n25%\n12,000 55%\n550\n12×2\n24\n25%\n13,200 60%\n600\n10×2\n20\n25%\n12,00 Bar Speed is 0.8 m/s avg Math plays a major role in increasing strength. If you can do the wave at your current max with the correct bar speed for speed strength development (about 0.8 m/s), you will create a new squat record on meet day. You must also raise max effort records all year long and work on your lagging muscle groups to complement the speed work, done 72 hours before. I will now give you some parameters of how to establish a contest max on a box squat with no knee wraps or suit straps up. Jean Fry, a 123-pound female, made a box squat with 280 pounds plus 140 pounds of band tension at the top, which equals 420 pounds. She did a strong 415-pound squat at a meet. As you can see, the top value is a strong indicator of how much you can squat at meet time. On the high end 500 pounds of bar weight and 375 pounds of band tension will translate to a squat of at least 800 pounds. Tony Ramos made 470 pounds of bar weight plus 375 pounds of band tension on a box squat and squatted 810 pounds at the Cincinnati Pro-Am at 181 pounds bodyweight. A bar weight of 550 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension will translate to an 850-pound squat. A bar weight of 600 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension will, and has many times, produce a 900-pound squat. A bar weight of 650 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension will produce a 950-pound squat. A bar weight of 600 pounds plus 440 pounds of band tension will equate to a 1000-pound squat. A bar weight of 650 pounds plus 440 pounds of band tension will produce a squat of 1050 pounds. Tony Bolognone squatted the following: 1000 pounds with 600 pounds bar weight and 440 pounds band tension 1050 pounds with 650 pounds bar weight and 440 pounds band tension 1100 pounds with 700 pounds bar weight and 440 pounds band tension 1130 pounds with 720 pounds bar weight and 440 pounds band tension I can show many such studies like this. After all, we have 16 men who squat at least 1000 pounds officially, plus 17 men who deadlift 800 pounds. Remember, the volume must match your max strength, your form must be flawless, and you must raise your max effort exercises and fortify your weaknesses. When using a variety of bars to squat with, you must calculate the different maxes from a contest max. Try a Safety Squat bar max, a 14-inch cambered bar max, a front squat max, and so forth. By using different bars you will avoid the volume accommodation effect. Tudor Bompa told me I was doing flat loading, but after explaining the rotation of bars and special exercises, I showed how to avoid all manners of the law of accommodation. All progress in the classical lifts, meaning the snatch, clean-jerk, squat, bench, and deadlift, depends on controlling volume and the intensity zones laid out by many European sports scientists. I found this to be the most important factor in making continuous gains and preventing injuries. It is very important to maintain proper bar speed while doing all sets. Just look at the equation F = mA (force equals mass times acceleration), or look at the definition of power. Power is defined as work done divided by the time used to do the work, or P = W/t. The more powerful one is, the faster he or she can do the work. Next, match the work by your physical capabilities by controlling volume on speed development day with moderate intensity zones. On max effort day, 72 hours later, use a lower volume, 50% on average, with maximal intensity, hopefully more than 100%. Lastly, it is also important to perfect your form. This method will prolong your lifting career and make it possible to lift your most.\nLouie Simmons\nReferencesBompa, Tudor. Theory and Methodology of Training. 1999.Medvedyev, A. S.

Mike’s motto is no mistakes and there were none. It was held at the Fairfield Banquet and Convention Hall, a beautiful venue. With the help of Jesse Rodgers, founder and President of the S.P.F., who supplies the equipment which includes identical equipment in the warm-up room as on the lifting platform, Four monolifts with safety straps, four Forza benches, all Okie Deadlift bars, Texas Power Bars and four Mastodon Bars were used. No surprises on the platform. Mike and Jesse’s work is well recognized and appreciated. The price money was huge in the amount of $23,700. It came from our gracious sponsors such as Musclepharm, Rogue Fitness, Legend fitness, Cell Block Gym, Powerstation Gym, Jump Stretch, Westside Barbell, Atlarge Nutrition, APT, House of Pain, Clarks Auto, Billy Ayash, Sweatt Shop Gym, Eaton Barbell and Anderson Powerlifting.\nThe referees were from the S.P.F. who was Wade Johnson, Joe Ladiner, Mark Bell, Brad Bishop and Jesse Rodgers. In the past, I have brought referees from the I.P.A., W.P.C. the former W.P.O. and even the I.P.F. to eliminate politics. But this year their governing bodies refused permission to judge the Powerstation Pro/Am, threatening to suspend some for a year. I can honestly see why. If the lifters from those organizations came to a real meet with great equipment, good judging and $23,700 they would stay in the S.P.F., the best organization for powerlifting in the United States. Thanks for men like Mike Ferguson and Jesse Rodgers for their tireless help.\nOn Saturday, the light weight Pro’s took the stage. There was nothing light about the lifting as we were about to find out. At 148 lbs body weight, Mike Anderson was impressive squatting at 630 lbs, benching 385 lbs and a 500 lbs deadlift to total 1515 and take first place. In second, Westside Barbell L.J. Hackett made 525 lbs squat opener, 360 lbs bench press and a 525 lbs deadlift to hit 1410.\nAt 165 lbs body weight, Laura Phelps was the only remaining lifter after Brian Schwab bombed in the squat. He came in very light at 157 lbs body weight that could have affected him somewhat.\nBack to Laura, lifting for Westside, she opened at 700 lbs and took all three attempts to make it. After a shaky start she was four for four making 455 lbs opener 485 lbs on the second and a world record 510 lbs on a third bench. But not to be out done, a fourth at 525 lbs was blasted up, unreal for a woman. There are only a handful of women who can qualify for the Powerstation Pro/Am which requires a male USPF elite total. I hope to see more next year. If there is more then one, we will offer cash. Laura makes token 155 lbs deadlift, and then proceeded to pull 515 lbs and 545 lbs to total 1755 world record. And on top of that tried 585 lbs world record but missed. She is the current queen of powerlifting and the king would be up soon.\nAfter Westsider Tony Ramos bombed in the bench press, the 181’s had four competitors left. My friend of many years, Sakari Selekainaho of Finland came to lift, doing the best of his life at 48 years old. At an all time 770 lbs squat, an all time 495 lbs bench, and a turn down at 510 lb bench and a 535 lbs deadlift, to give Sakari a lift time 1800 lbs total.\nNext up Westside’s Arnold Coleman came in third place. Nursing some injuries, Arnold made 700 lbs squat and passed his third; a 550 lbs opener bench and misses 600 lbs. then after a 650 lbs opener pull two close misses 695 lbs to leave behind a 1900 lbs total.\nBrian Tincher from Orlando Barbell was strong, making all three squats ending with 805 lbs. In the bench, again three for three, getting a 575 lb. bench. Brian made a 645 lbs opener in deadlift with misses at 665 lbs to total 2025 lbs.\nIn first place, Al Caslow of Big Iron Gym moved up from the 165 lbs class and it was a good move. At 177 lbs body weight he was three for three with a huge 910 lbs third. He should have tried a forth. Al’s opener bench at 525 lbs was solid. A miss then success with 540 lbs and he was off to a great sub total 1450 lbs. He walked through his deadlifts with 620 lbs, 650 lbs and 675 lbs to total 2125.\nThe 198’s had a casualty when Derek Wilcox squatted 865 lbs but bombed in the bench. This left one man, Mike Cartinian from Big Iron. Mike is the current world record holder in the squat and total at 181 lbs body weight but came in at a full 198 lbs body weight. We know he is a squat machine making 900 lbs, 950 lbs and a strong 975 lbs on his third. Mike can also bench, going three for three again. 685 lbs, 705 lbs and finally 715 lbs. Mike began his pulls with 610 lbs. and two more good deadlifts finishing with 660 lbs to total 2350, not bad to say the least.\nThe last class on Saturday was the 220’s but what a show! Chris Della-Fave of Skiba’s gym looked good in the squat, making 900 lbs, but the 600 lbs mark ended the show for Chris. This left four to battle it out.\nIn fourth place was the return of Phil Harrington of Cincinnati, Ohio. Phil squatted well as always making 890 lbs on a third. Injuries have hurt his bench, making 440 lbs on a second with a close miss at 465 lbs on his third. After opening at 610 lbs easy, 675 lbs and 715lbs would not go. This left Phil with 1940 lbs total and I am sure we have not seen the last of Phil.\nIn third place and in a close battle for second was Dan Tinajero only 23 years old from Orlando Barbell Club. It does not happen often for a great lifter to go nine for nine in a great meet. Dan squatted 840 lbs and a strong 670 lbs bench press to sub total 1510 lbs. An easy 625 lbs opener and Dan finished with 700 lbs to total 2210 lbs.\nIn second place from the Ukraine, Vlad Venglovschi came to lift in the strongest meet in the world. After a strong 880 lbs opener and a fine 925 lbs second, 965 lbs on a third was a touch too much. The bench gave him some trouble. A miss at 605lbs, but good on a repeat and finally 640 lbs was too heavy. The trip must be hard on the lifters traveling half way around the world as Vlad missed his opener deadlift at 705 lbs. He came back to make it on a second only to miss 770 lbs on his third, but a second place 2235 lbs total that I hope was reward enough to come back next year.\nNow its show time! I take my hat off to Rick Hussey and his Big Iron bunch for being a well coached team as well as incredibly strong. The strongest was about to take center stage. Shawn Frankl, a Big Iron freak began his assault on the record books with two solid squats at 1005 lbs and 1060 lbs passing his third. Believe it or not Shawn was nursing a rib injury. His bench pressing was perfect at 875 lbs on a third to sub total a crazy for a 220’er 1935 lbs! Can he deadlift? Yes, 725 lbs was smoke a PR at 765 lbs for his second and a strong 780 lbs on his third to hit 2715 lbs total. Shawn now holds the 198 lbs and 220 lbs world total records. Will he go for the 242 lbs total as well? After all he is 75 lbs over the 242 lbs record now. Just how much can Shawn lift in the future? Nobody knows but the freak.\nThe cash winners:\nShawn Frankl $5,000\nMike Cartinian $2,000\nAl Caslow $1,500 Heavy Weight Pro The Sunday crew was a well balanced group. First up was the 242 lbs class. In third, was Shane Church of Westside Barbell. Shane hit a solid opener at 910 lbs, but was out of the grove with a second 960 lbs but came back to make it on a third. In the bench a 535 lbs opener was all there was that day. Shane made 625 lbs on his first. A second at 650 lbs was smooth but 680 lbs stalled at mid thigh. A 2145 lbs total and a third place at the Powerstation Pro/Am. His team mate Luke Edwards was determined to lift even after being ill before the meet. But it did not stop Luke from squatting 870 lbs before missing 930 lbs. The bench when better going 625 lbs for his opener and a good 650 lbs on his second and passed his third. A 750 lbs first attempt was it for today and a 2270 lbs total put Luke in to second place.\nThe 242 lbs class winner for 2010 lbs is Clint Smith. His balance attack with squats of 875 lbs and 930 lbs on a second attempt but no good on 955 lbs. His bench looked great with a 765 lbs opener 785 lbs on a second but 805 lbs proved too much. Clint is also a solid deadlifter going 725 lbs, 755lbs on a second and miss at 770 lbs for a 2470 total for first place at 242 lbs class.\nIt was to be a showdown between three top 275 lbs. Chuck Vogelpohl from Lexen Extreme, Brian Carroll unattached, Dave Hoff of Westside, Mark Bell of Supertraining gym, Rich Douglass of Westside and Pat Hakola unattached battled to win this tough class. After an 1100 lbs squat Brian Carroll could not make any of his benches co-operate and was gone. Tough luck Brain, see you next year.\nThis left four to fight it out for three trophies. In fourth was Rich Douglas, a new Westside member. Rich went from 800 lbs, 850 lbs and a fine 900 lbs for a 60 lbs personal record. The benches were good as well. A 630 lbs opener than 680 lbs and his second but 700 lbs was a no go. After 700 lbs opener, 770 lbs to total 2350 which was a 150 lbs increase in 6 months. And a miss at 805 lbs and Rich was done for the day with 2350 lbs. In third Mark “Smelly” Bell from Super Training gym. He hit two good squats at 900 lbs and 935 lbs on his second, but 970 lbs proved too much on this day. We were looking for fireworks in the bench but not today. 760 lbs was no good on his opener, a good repeat with the same 760 lbs. A shirt change and all the way up to 880 lbs is Smelly crazy or what? The 880 lbs would not go for the inventor of the Sling Shot, on this day. His deadlifts went from 650 lbs of his opener, 705 lbs on a second, but 745 lbs was too much with a 2400 lbs total and a third place secured and the two-time loser was done but not forgotten.\nIn second place was powerlifting icon Chuck Vogelpohl of Lexen Extreme. He was a national champion in 1987 and now in 2010 holds the world record squat at 1140 lbs at 242 lbs body weight and the 1175 lbs at 275 lbs body weight. He came in rather light at 255 lbs but opened at 1075 lbs and blew it up. He was off balanced with 1155 lbs and fell backwards. An all time 1175 lbs was loaded on the bar. Out he came like a mad man and destroys it for three white lights. The bench was next up and a 330 lbs opener was good; 565 lbs on the second and a good 610 lbs on his third. Now on to what he likes, the deadlift. A cautious 750 lbs opener, 800 lbs on his second and finally a strong 840 lbs was pulled to lockout only to pop out of his hands. Even without the 840 lbs pull, Chuck totaled 2585 lbs. When will it end for this man who personifies powerlifting?\nThis leaves one, or is he the chosen one? Dave “Neutron” Hoff of Westside. Dave opened at 970. A 1040 lb squat on the second was strong, but not as strong as the 1075 lbs third attempt. The man can bench as well. 810 lbs opener, 860 lbs on his second and 880 lbs was out of the groove. At subtotal time read 1935 lbs. “Neutron opened at 775lbs for 2710 lbs total, the biggest ever at Westside, 805 lbs of his second to move it up to 2740 lbs. And with a back like Iron, a 815 lbs on the third to make it official 2750 lbs and the winner at 275 lbs body weight. Dave is one of the most consistent lifters ever at Westside and the second to surpass 2700 lbs for the club.\nThe 308’s were represented at the Pro/Am. Six strong men competed for top honors. In fifth place was Rick Lahourcade, the tattooed Powerhouse from out west was very light at 278 lbs. A 905 lbs opener was all Rickey could get passed on this day. The benches went a lot better going three for three. Starting at 650 lbs then moving on to 675 lbs on a second and a fine 700 lbs on a third attempt. Rickey is surprisingly strong in the deadlift for his stocky build. A 705 lbs opener deadlift was a smoke show. A great 750 lbs on his second, and a pass on his third to total 2355 lbs.\nTony Bolognone of Westside squatted 1130 lbs only to bomb in the bench. In fourth place was Henry Thomason, a squatting machine making 1060 lbs, 1115 lbs on a second and finally 1165 lbs on a third. Henry even tried a world record 1200 lbs on a fourth but had trouble getting set and passed. He opened benches with 660 lbs but 720 lbs and 730 lbs would not cooperate on the second and third attempt. With his massive build, the deadlift is tough for Henry. A 600 lbs opener was easy. 675 lbs on the second but 710 lbs was not to be. With 2500 lbs he set back to see what would happen. In third place Matt Hammock, he weighed only 283 lbs not able to make the 275 lbs class but it does not matter at the Pro/Am, you can run but you can’t hide. And Matt doesn’t have to hide from anyone. After a strong 1015 lbs opener and a good 1040 lbs second he passed his third squat. In the bench, Matt opened at 705 lbs moved on to 725 lbs on a second for a good attempt and again passed his third. He had to move ahead of Henry Thomason so 735 lbs opener deadlift moved Matt into third on bodyweight. A strong 755 lbs pull on his second passed his total to 2520 lbs and after a miss at 770 lbs he had to be satisfied with 2520 lbs for today. But I can see much bigger things to come from Matt soon.\nIn second place was Jake Anderson from Westside. His squats were flawless: 930 lbs, a strong 1005 lbs on his second and a great 1050 lbs on the third. A 685 lbs opener bench was good. 735 lbs would not touch and a jump to 760 lbs blew out his shirt. Next up were the deadlifts. Jakes opener was easy at 755 lbs. 815lbs was a toy on his second and a final 835 lbs was pulled easy only to get off balance and fall forward after locking it out. But when the smoke cleared Jake totaled 2550 lbs for second place behind Westside teammate AJ Roberts. AJ walked through three squats, 990 lbs on his opener, 1075 lbs on the second and a strong 1100 lbs on his third. His benches were down a little with 770 lbs opener but two miss at 825 lbs was a no go. In the deadlift his opener 735 lbs was easy. A second with 780 lbs was good and insured him of first place with 2650 lbs total. A third attempt with 800 lbs was close\nThe one and only SHW was Paul Childress from Buffalo. Paul has had it tough for a couple years but he’s back. A 1050 lbs opener and an 1115 lbs second attempt were good but 1160 lbs was not passed. Paul’s opener bench with 710 lbs was no go. A good 735 lbs on his second to stay in the game but 750 lbs would not happen today. After a 730 lbs opener a strong 770 lbs on his second was good, only to miss 800 lbs on his third. But a 2620 total isn’t bad for a come back. Now the prize money\nAJ Roberts for third $1,500\nChuck Vogelpohl for second $2,000\nDave Hoff for first $5,000\nBest Bench Press Shawn Frankl $1,000\nBench Squat Chuck Vogelpohl $1,000\nBest Deadlift Shawn Frankl $1,000\nThe champion of champions is Shawn Frankl who walked away with $10,370. Next year will be better.\nCongratulations to the following lifters from the Amateur Day who qualified for next years Pro day; 181 lbs class Marty Bavetz 1815 lbs total; 220 lbs class Zane Geeting 2150 lbs total; 220 lbs class Joe Jester 2075 lbs total.\nLouie Simmons",

This is called periodization. In 1917, Kotov, of the former Soviet Union, wrote a series of texts about training that considered general preparatory and specific needs. Most lifters would use a progressive gradual overload system. Here, the reps were high in the beginning with light weights. Then over time the weight became heavier and the reps lower, leading up to a contest. This is simply a detraining system. The muscle-building phase is first, along with speed strength. As the weights grow larger and the reps are decreased, the hypertrophy is lost. The maximal strength phase begins, but bar acceleration speed is lost and contest training consumes the bulk of the training. This makes peaking for a meet very unpredictable. Dr. Matveyev realized in 1981 a more sophisticated wave periodization must be utilized than his first models in 1964. Sports scientists such as Verkhoshansky, Vorobyev, and Ermakov found the same to be true. The system of equal loading of skill and strength training was common in track and field. This was also considered by Bondarchuk, but Bondarchuk’s idea was to develop skill first to take advantage of the strength increases. Top Olympic lifters in the former Soviet Union would use over 50% of their training on special exercises to increase the totals. Around 80 special exercises and 20 skills, while wave loading, were given priority for about 5-8 weeks at a time by Verkhoshansky in the late 1970s. This was to contribute to the next wave of 5-8 weeks. This system was for highly qualified athletes and lifters. Westside training is much more weighted toward special exercises. Our waves never last longer than 3 weeks for speed strength and 2 weeks for strength speed. For Olympic lifters, squatting was front and back squats with only one bar. Westside can change volume in the same intensity zones by using a wide variety of special bars, but what about programming? What does it consists of? What do you change during the year? I feel top powerlifters should compete two times a year in a full power meet and maybe one bench meet or one deadlift meet. There are four phases of training in a yearly plan. They should start after a meet. As the training continues, it is important to know the terminology and what is expected during each and every training phase leading up to an important contest. Let’s look at each phase independently starting with the accumulation phase.\nAccumulation Phase First many would consider this off-season training, but athletes cannot have time off: no vacation, just training and work toward increasing their ability. At Westside, we concentrate on improving bar speed in all squatting and deadlifting workouts on Friday and on Sunday for speed strength benching, commonly known as the dynamic day. We rotate many special bars to change the volume while maintaining the same bar speed at the same intensity zone, or percentages. The training must be dense, meaning very short rests between sets. You must work to raise your training volume at all percentages; adding hypertrophy, increasing bar speed, and perfecting technique are essential. This period of training was intended to increase speed of movements in all sports, especially track and field, but we use this period after a meet for all aspects of increasing special strength gains as we work on weaknesses to increase skills in all lifts and also increasing GPP. After all, you must recover from more difficult workouts to succeed in any sport.\nIntensification Phase In this phase of training the lifter or athlete will push his or her training toward the sport itself. For a powerlifter the 3-week wave style of cycling is essential. Using the same exercises for more than 3 weeks creates a negative result. The 3-week wave will help eliminate this phenomenon. In this period of training you must increase the rest time between working sets. The training is now directed toward your sporting goals. For the powerlifter, this means reducing the fun exercises and start using ones that build strength specific to powerlifting.\nTransformation Phase This period of training starts the competitive phase for track and field. At Westside this is the circa-max phase, based solely on the squat training weeks. In week 1 work up to the top weight of your all-time best. For Westside that means a box record. During week 2, work up to approximately 90% of your all-time best. In week 3 use 50% of your all-time best for 2 sets of 2 reps. Week 4 is the meet. Note: A 3-week reverse wave pendulum is used.\nDelayed Transformation This reverse wave loading was used for Naim Suleymanoglu by his coach Abadjiev. The transformation phase lasted for 3 weeks. The third week revolves into the delayed transformation, or rest period. During the transformation phase, deadlifts for sets are used at moderate percents. Not counting abs, only two or three special exercises are used. Westsiders will wear a bench shirt 3 weeks out, and the last heavy pull is also 3 weeks out. I hope you can relate to a plan that is intended to maximize the weight lifted at contest time. If you use this plan, you will not be scratching your head and wondering why the weights you lifted in the gym did not materialize at meet time.\nLouie Simmons ReferencesEmverturkileri, Y.; Suleymanoglu, N.

He first came to the United States as a foreign exchange student in 2001, weighing in at a mere 170 pounds. In addition, he had never lifted weights before. He began lifting on a program based on Bigger, Faster, Stronger, a basic program that included box squats, benching, deadlifting, cleans, and incline presses.\nHe graduated high school at 210 pounds with a 400-pound squat, a 205-pound bench, and a 540-pound deadlift. He really got into powerlifting in 2004, when he started training with Brent Mikesell, a world record holder in the SHW squat, making an 1141-pound squat at the WPO. That year was A.J.’s first power meet. He made a 545-pound squat, a 365-pound bench, and a 560-pound deadlift at 220 bwt. He made his first Elite total in 2005 at 275 bwt. In 2006, he made a 2297-pound total. Later that year, he won the WPC worlds with an 880 squat, a 699 bench, and a 705 deadlift in the 308s. He made his first 1000-pound squat in 2007. In 2009, at the SPF he made a 1008-pound squat, a 710 bench, and a 710 deadlift, for a 2500-pound total. At the Guerilla Squat Classic he made a 1035 squat, an 805 bench, and a 760 deadlift for a 2600 total.\nIn less than two years he has gone from a 2428-pound total to a 2600-pound total. What’s the method behind the total increase? First and foremost it’s his training partners. They’re some of the best in the world, including Tony Bolognone, with a 2705 total; Dave Hoff (Neutron), with a 2685 total; Matt Smith, with a 2671 total; and Luke Edwards, with a 2450 total and 840 deadlift, just to name a few. Westside has what it takes to reach the top, such as the Plyo Swing, the Reverse Hyper machine, and all of the bars. But without intense and logical training and helping each other, none of this would be possible.\nFor squatting, A.J. is just starting to hit his stride. He has always box squatted, but when we widened his stance, he blew up a 1035-pound squat. We found his hips were tight, so he started doing a lot of stretching, which made all the difference. Many have this problem but ignore the fact and become stuck or go backward in their progress in the squat and can’t lockout their deadlift. Next, A.J. started pushing up the average percent of his squat workouts. A second plus was raising the deadlift volume. He did lots of sets of 3-5 reps in the power rack with bands and ultra-wide sumo deadlifts with bands. We use the multiple sets for developing the muscles that contribute not only to deadlifting but also squatting.\nOn Friday, the volume must be extremely high while the intensity is moderate to moderately high. Three days later on Monday, the bar volume averages 30-60% of Friday’s workout. The intensity is 100%+ of our current physical preparedness. On max effort day, A.J. will work up to a max single 80% of the time. The other 20% is 3 reps of good mornings or 3-5 reps in the ultra-wide sumo. A.J. does a lot of special bars to squat with or do good mornings. On both days sled pulling for strength or strength endurance is done, and many times he does light sled pulling for his warmup before the speed squat or on max effort day for squatting and deadlifting. Reverse Hyper machine and glute/ham raises are two main exercises that are done in high volume. A.J. also pays a lot of attention to flexibility. Two small workouts for the squat and deadlift are done in the afternoon. His main training sessions are at 8 a.m. His bench training is typical Westside. In a span of less than two years his bench has gone from 710 to 805. How did A.J. do this? Let’s take a look.\nOn speed day, he will rotate from mini- to monster mini-bands to chains. Sometimes he uses a combination of chains and bands. Other times he will choke a mini or monster mini to cause an abrupt loading at lockout. He uses a close grip just touching the smooth part of bar, two inches out with little finger touching the power ring. He does 9 sets of 3 reps; sometimes after a meet he will use 9 sets of 5 reps. The intensity is the same, but the volume is considerably higher to regain muscle mass. A.J., like other Westsiders, will do a rest pause system on speed day. A.J. will do a set, then rest 10 seconds and do a second set, rest 10 seconds and do a third set, rest 2 minutes and repeat. This is done for 3-4 series, or a total of 9-12 sets. This will really stimulate your body for a change of pace. Of course he will change bars quite often. A power bar, a 2-inch-cambered bar, a football bar, a T-grip bar, or an arch bar is rotated in and out of his speed cycle. He does a couple sets of dumbbell presses with a moderate weight or two light sets of benches, one ultra-wide and one close grip for a set each with 15 reps. This is a warmup before triceps work. A.J. will rotate from dumbbell roll-backs to extensions with the elbows out. When they start to fail, A.J. goes to the J.M. press and straight bar triceps extensions. He does board press but only as a tester, not a builder. Some side and rear delt work, hammer curls, and lat work, and he is done.\nLike George Halbert, A.J. thinks speed work is most important, but max effort is a must. A.J. does max effort work on Wednesday. This makes it possible to taper the heavy work 10 days out from a contest. He will do speed work on Sunday, which leaves 6 or 7 days to rest for a contest.\nWednesday is our max effort day. A.J. does not have a favorite, but the floor press with 200 pounds of chains is a main indicator of how strong he is for a contest. He will rotate between several exercises in no particular order: 2-3 board press; maxing out with chains, bands, and real weight; rack lockouts from 2 inches off chest to 4 inches from lockout; incline and decline press with a barbell using close and wide grips; and dumbbell pressing at all angles. He also does more muscle building with push-ups with weight on his back. Each week A.J. changes the max effort work, never doing the same exercise 2 weeks in a row. He will put a bench shirt on about every 4 weeks. Lots of triceps extensions have put almost 100 pounds on his bench in a year and a half.\nOnly time will tell where A.J. will be in the next year and a half; so stay tuned to the Westside channel and find out.\nLouie Simmons",

How do you build a big deadlift if you weren’t born with one? Ernie Frantz always said that to increase your deadlift, you should just deadlift.\nWestside has always relied on a lot of special exercises, but we have done more deadlifting in the form of speed pulls in the last few years. After the speed day for squatting, we will do multiple sets of deadlifts off the floor with bands over the bar. We have always done a lot of rack pulls on max effort day. But in 2007, we started doing rack pulls with bands: a monster mini alternated with light Jump-Stretch bands. They are quadrupled up to produce a large, fast-acting accommodation of resistance. This style of rack pulling is done for max effort work, working up to a max single, but also for up to 10 sets of 3-5 reps done with a conventional stance. The multiple sets are done after speed squat sets. This has added up to 15,000 pounds of volume in the precise deadlift muscles. I just pulled a 670-pound deadlift. My max band pull with the plates 4 or 6 inches off the floor is 430 with light bands and 530 with monster mini bands.\nLuke Edward’s best is 585 pounds with light bands and 675 pounds with monster mini bands. Luke’s total volume can approach 20,000 pounds of work. The system builds a strong lock-out, a powerful start, and a very strong grip. Luke has an 840 official deadlift at around 260 pounds, a 920 squat, and a 2226 total. The bonus is that his squat form has changed to a more mechanically effective method that pushed his 920 squat to 1025 at the same 242 bodyweight. His deadlift program is to alternate the pause sets of 3-5 reps in the power rack with ultra-wide sumo band pulls off the floor. A test of progress is to pull real weight off the floor ultra-wide, wider than a normal sumo stance, or pull in a rack off low pins. Luke has made 705 pounds for 3 reps ultra-wide and 805 pounds with the plates 2 inches off the floor and 845 pounds with the plates 4 inches off the floor. The multiple sets with bands in the power rack for 3-5 reps with a conventional stance are a builder. So are the ultra-wide deadlifts with bands, with feet to the plates, for not only the deadlift but also the squat. They do this by building all the crucial muscles that increase the squat.\nThe ultra-wide sumo with just bar weight is a tester. The rack pulls with plates off the ground 2 ½, 4 ½, or 6 ½ inches are also a tester. By doing this style of training there is little emotional stress. It is truly a training max. Many times one becomes too psyched up, which leads to a long recovery time emotionally, especially if you miss a lift. After deadlifting, Luke will do 4-6 sets on the Reverse Hyper machine. He will alternate glute/ham raises with heavy weight for 4-8 reps with doing 200 leg curls with 10- or 20-pound ankle weights. The high reps will build and thicken the ligaments and tendons.\nTo withstand the high volume/high-intensity training, sled pulls play a large role in Luke’s training. He uses heavy weight early in the week to build absolute strength in the legs, back, and hips. Monday is max effort day. The weight is decreased during the week’s training, and the trips are increased. This will build strength endurance. Late in the week the sled pulls are lightened again for restoration or a warmup for Friday speed development day. The sled pulls are done for 60 yards. The heaviest weights are done for 6-8 trips. The moderate sled pulls are done for 8-12 trips, and the lightest pulls on Thursday or Friday are again done for 6-8 trips. The heavy pulls are done immediately after the barbell work. After the light pulls on Friday he is ready to squat. Luke does a lot of leg raises, and he also does sit-ups with a 6-inch foam roller under his low back. Side bends conclude his ab work.\nRemember, Friday speed squats are done for 6-8 sets on average for doubles. Speed pulls are done in a rack with a conventional stance with 250 or 350 pounds of band tension. The weight ranges from 315 to 405 pounds for 6-10 sets of pause reps for sets of 3 or 5 reps. He will alternate the rack work with ultra-wide sumo pulls with his feet out to the plates. This makes Friday’s workout a very high volume/moderate intensity workout that can be over 20,000 pounds. On max effort day Luke will alternate good mornings with low special-bar squats or a max rack pull. Here are his best pulls: 805 pounds 2 ½ inches off the floor; 845 pounds 4 ½ inches off the floor, and 875 pounds 6 ½ inches off the floor. You notice the heaviest rack pull is only 35 pounds over his best pull of 840 pounds. His best pause 3 in the ultra-wide sumo is 705 pounds for 3 reps. So, what is Luke’s secret? Hard work.\nMy advice to you is to get to it and good luck.\nLoui Simmons",

First, you need a good power rack so you don’t get hurt. Second of course are plates and dumbbells and then some bars. Notice I said bars. There are other ways to do contrast training other than bands, chains, and weight releasers. When it comes to equipment, bars can completely change a gym. For instance, when doing max effort work, you can have a record with a bow bar, front squat bar, Zercher squat bar, Safety squat bar, a regular squat bar, or a 14-inch cambered bar. They all have a value of their own.\nIn Olympic lifting, they have primarily two squat records to base their max squats on: front and back with the same bar. This also limits the volume of squats one can do in a workout at a certain intensity zone. Even when training at different intensity zones, there are only two varieties of squats to work with. But with several bars to work with you could expand your max effort exercises. I have seen one exercise totally change a lifter’s progress. It could be a front squat, which Eddie Copeland used to develop his 826 deadlift at 186 bodyweight, or the Safety squat bar, sometimes called the Hatfield bar because of the success Dr. Squat, aka Fred Hatfield, had with it to the point of squatting 1014 at 256, just about the biggest squat of all time regardless of bodyweight, or the Zercher squat lift, invented by Ed Zercher and used to a great degree by Bob Barnett to pull 675 at 165 bodyweight in the late 1960s. Alexander Karelin also used the Zercher squat or lifted off the floor to demoralize his opponents.\nHow can a bar help avoid accommodation? By changing total volume without compromising bar speed at the same percentage of a one-rep max when training for power development at 40% to 50% for multiple sets. If your front squat record is 500, 50% would be 250. If your Safety squat bar best is 600, then 300 is 50%, and if your regular box squat max is 700, you would use 350. The front squat volume for 12 sets of 2 reps is 6,000. The Safety squat bar volume for 12 sets is 7,200. The box squat with a regular bar would be 8,400 pounds total volume. The sets remain the same in a three-week pendulum wave. The percentages are the same. The bar speed remains the same, but the total will be altered by using different bars with different maxes. This is very important to avoid accommodation. See the Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. M. Zatsiorsky (1995). The same scenario can be used when using a bow bar, a 14-inch cambered bar, or a Zercher squat bar.\nWhen we do max effort work at Westside, we switch a barbell exercise each week. This will help eliminate accommodation while maxing out. The different bars make it possible to change a squat or good morning exercise. Of course, using different heights, boxes, or stances while doing the exercise helps. The bars are constantly rotated to change the amount of weight one can use. This concept holds true when speed benching as well. An arch bar requires a maximal grip and a different hand position. A 3-inch cambered bar will work similarly to a 5-inch cambered bar but with a different range of motion. A bow bar that has a 2-inch camber is not quite as radical. A football bar with three parallel grips is a great change of pace to bench with. A T-grip bar with slightly different grip angles is big at Westside. Lifters at Westside will do not only triceps work with a 7-foot EZ curl bar but also speed and max effort work .\nA great bar for rehab or better yet for prehab is the Bandbell bar. It is a special bar made of fiberglass that vibrates when you hang kettlebells or light plates from it. You do this by fastening mini-bands around the bar and through the kettlebells or plates. This causes a chaotic osculating pendulum effect. This bar enabled me to bench 300 just 3 months after shoulder socket surgery.\nJust like speed day for squatting, the percent of a bench max can change by rotation of specialty bars. This too will change the amount of volume on speed day, as each bar has its own max.\nThere have always been squat bars, power bars, and deadlift bars, but the specialty bars can completely change the potential of a gym. A gym can increase its variety by obtaining many bars to choose from and rotate regularly. Bands, chains, and weight releasers play a large role in our gym’s success and so does using a wide variety of bars.\nLouie Simmons",

However, due to lack referencing, widely varyings opinions (mostly Incorrect) on implementing this style of training, and a crazy surge in social media savvy strength coaches there is a disconnect between Westside Barbell and the system that Louie Simmons could be credited with revolutionizing or at the very least popularizing for the modern day coach and athlete. Louie has been writing about this system for over 30 years. Every year it refines and updates and we try to put out as much free content as possible. Draw your own opinions from the source not from a third party. Take a look at this article published in 2010. Tom Get The Book of methods Today Your variants will appear here Buy Now How Was It Developed? Many have asked how Westside developed the conjugate system and why. I started training full time in powerlifting in late 1969 after returning from the army. I had my first power meet in 1966. What an experience! I lifted along with four future world champions: Milt McKinney, George Crawford, who gave me countless tips on squatting, Larry Pacifico, and Vince Anello, who was the deadlifting machine. I asked Vince what helped his deadlift. His reply, “everything helps my deadlift.” It sounded vague, but Vince was using the conjugate system, although it was unnamed. George was the squat king. His training was a combination of regular squats, box squats, old Westside style (meaning Culver City, CA, style), rack squats, and good mornings, which contributed to his success. This is the conjugate system, a system of unidirectional loading that was designed to enable him to squat more. Larry Pacifico, who was a renowned powerlifter in the 1970s and early 1980s was great at everything, but his bench was unreal. His bench training was a combination of heavy-duty bodybuilding and lots of triceps work. Larry told me that 75% of our bench success was from the triceps.\nWith their advice, which they gave me freely at meets, and following the methodologies of the Culver City Westside group, I came up with the Westside conjugate system. Bill “Peanuts” West was the founder of the Culver City Westside Barbell Club. George Frenn was a world record holder in powerlifting and in the 56-pound weight throw. They had countless special exercises such as rack pulls, box pulls, high pulls, good mornings, box squatting on at least three different height boxes, benching with rubber mats on the chest, floor pressing, rack lockouts, and so forth. Their rotation of exercises was space-age at the time, which was 1965 to the early 1970s. The system was the conjugate sequence system, although it was not named yet. The training I was doing at the time was influenced by everyone mentioned above. Progressive Gradual Overload = Dead End Street The only true problem I had was the loading. There were no Soviet secrets being leaked to the United States at that time. The progressive gradual overload system was being used in the U.S. It was divided into different time periods, or blocks, designed to work on a specific element of training. I am amazed that lifters are still using it today. It’s a dead-end street. The young lifters believe it’s a new from of periodization. Maybe they think the push button starters on some new cars are also new, but all cars had a starter button in the 1940s. I was always stronger a week or two after a meet or a week or two before the meet, but very seldom on meet day. The Soviets had coaches, like Matveyev, who realized there was a much better method of planning. There has always been controversy over who came up with wave periodization. Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky has been credited with the pendulum wave . This was in 1964. Even the renowned Bulgarian coach Abadjieve had a similar plan for waving volume and intensities.\nIn 1972, the Dynamo Club had 70 highly qualified weight lifters do an experiment by rotating 25-45 special exercises including the classical lifts. After the experiments were done, one lifter was satisfied and the rest wanted more. It now had a name: the conjugate system. I was training alone and used lots of special exercises for all three lifts to reduce staleness. When you use the same routine over and over, you fail to make progress. This is known as accommodation. To avoid this, a rotation of exercises small and large must be cycled in and out of the plan. I followed this system without knowing it had a name for years, 13 years to be exact. Broke My Back, AGAIN! It was in 1983 when I broke my lower back for the second time. I thought there had to be a better way. I started to buy books such as the Soviet Sports Review,translated by Dr. Yessis, and the Soviet training manuals that Bud Charniga Jr. had translated. Bud told me that these are textbooks. This is just what I was looking for. They opened my eyes. They are very math/physics oriented, with a basis on Newton’s laws of motion. I was hooked. I had totaled my first Elite U.S.P.F. total of 1655 in February 1973. I used no gear, not even wraps on my knees or elbows or even wrists, just an Olympic weight belt, no power belt. If I wanted to continue to make progress, I had to get stronger and I had to get smarter, much smarter. I started all over. First I used the pendulum wave in 3-week cycles, going from training a heavy and a light day, to a max effort day, working to a max single depending on my level of preparedness. A severe workout can be done every 72 hours, and the second day is devoted to the development of special strengths. It could be explosive strength, commonly known as the dynamic method. Westside Conjugate System is Born The Westside conjugate system is the best of two advanced training systems: the Soviet system, where several special exercises are used to advance the training of superior lifters and athletes, and the Bulgarian system, where near-max lifts are performed every workout. The Westside system is a combination of the two.\nScience has proven that training at a 90% or above for 3 weeks will cause physical and mental fatigue. With the Westside conjugate method we switch a core barbell exercise each week to avoid accommodation. The wide variety of special exercises will perfect form. The similarities of the Westside conjugate system to the one devised by the Soviets at the Dynamo Club are obvious. The only difference is the exercises: one system for Olympic lifting and of course the other for powerlifting. What I took from the Soviets was the sequence of wave loading. A. S. Prilepin was instrumental in regulating the number of repetitions and sets at a particular intensity zone. This truly enlightened me about the importance of calculating volume at each intensity zone and why it is a waste of time to do too many reps at a given intensity zone. Men such as Verkhoshansky, Bondarchuk, Matveyev, Vorobyev, and many more helped lead the way.\nWestside pendulum wave cycles last 3 weeks for speed and explosive strength and 2 weeks for strength speed work and utilize several special bars with which to establish different maxes. But because the reps and sets should remain the same at a given percent, the bar speed at this percent will remain the same. The volume will be different each week due to the difference between bar maxes. Your front squat max will be different from your safety squat bar max, and of course both will be different from your max squat. This is to avoid accommodation, which in this case is the constant overuse of the same loading patterns. The Soviets and Westside count only all-time records, which amounts to roughly 600 lifts a year, similar to contest max lifts. The Bulgarian system mandated that the current training maxes were based on that particular day’s strength, equaling about 4000 lifts a year. They were not based on a certain percent. This was determined by Coach Abadieve’s experiments. They used only six lifts: front squat, back squat, power clean, power snatch, clean and jerk, and snatch. One had to be well chosen for such a rigorous regiment of training. Westside’s system is to max out on this day according to your level of preparedness. This means that a Westside max effort is the most one is capable of that day. It may not be an all-time record, but it is the most you are capable of on that day, week after week. This is just like the Bulgarian training with the exception of the number of lifts. They would follow this system 6 days a week. Six maximum lifts were done in the morning. After a 30-minute rest 6 more maxes on pulling exercises plus 6 max squats, front or back. This was repeated in the afternoon and evening.\nWestside uses two max effort days a week, one for the squat and deadlift and one for benching; 72 hours separate a speed workout and max effort day for the same lift. Three lifts at 90% and above are advised. This is more practical for powerlifting, on the basis of using this max effort system for the last 26 years. Time, Experience and Science A lot of hours and work have gone into perfecting the Westside system. It has more variety, volume, reps, and intensity zones as well as exercises that literally number in the hundreds. It has been a 40-year odyssey of pain, work, and experimentation. Look at our Web site and compare our lifts to those of other gyms: 89 Elites, 14 who squat over 1000 and 4 over 1100; 30 who bench over 700 pounds and 4 over 800 pounds; 15 who deadlift over 800 pounds and 6 over 2500 pounds; 4 with a total over 2600 and 1 with a 2700-pound total. In addition, I have made a U.S.P.F. Elite total throughout the time period from February 1973 to December 2009, this last time at 62 years old.\nI hope this explains how the Westside conjugate system was created. I found the right way to train by observing the smart and resourceful lifters who succeeded compared to those who set their own plan and failed and withdrew from Westside.

We also have Laura Phelps, with a 505 at 165 body weight, who has the greatest female bench coefficient ever. Five members have held all-time world records in the bench. They all use a speed day, commonly referred to as the dynamic method. The weight is relatively light, but force = mass x acceleration. You must use bands or chains to accommodate resistance. This develops a fast rate of force development, which is essential to develop a fast start. This is done on the weekend, and 72 hours later is max effort day. Here, a max weight is lifted in a variety of special exercises. Here are some of their workouts: Floor press with weight, bands, or chains\nRack press off pins at different heights\nBand press with three band tensions\nBoard press using 1-5 boards, doing incline, wide, or close grip\nDecline presses with a wide or close grip\nFlat presses with a max 6 reps close grip while constantly changing the weight or the amount of bands or chains or weight releaser weight\nThree sets of dumbbells to failure. For example, use 100, 125, 150, and 175 pounds. Westside uses heavy dumbbells every 3 or 4 weeks. This system is built on special exercises. Our best benchers use a bench shirt every fourth week, on average.\nLet’s start with Tony Bolognone, who has a 2700-pound total at 325 bodyweight and an 860-pound bench. He explains some of his workouts: Speed bench for 8 sets of 3 reps with 225 pounds of bar weight and a light band for the first 4 sets. Add choked monster mini-bands for the last 4 sets. Starting hand grip is close, working all the way out to competition grip for the last two sets. He believes that adding the monster mini-bands for the least 4 sets teaches you to push through all the way to the top. Before adding the mini-bands, he noticed in his speed sets he was letting off three-quarters of the way up, so he would not over-extend his elbows. This caused him to mimic that in a bench shirt and get stuck three-quarters of the way up, trying to grind the weight out as he forgot to keep pushing. This problem seemed to go away after he added the mini-bands, and he consistently pushes all the way through the lift in his speed sets and with a bench shirt. After he started this, he hit his biggest benches of all time. His favorite bench accessory exercises are all types of triceps extensions and skull crushers. One of his favorite skull crushers is using the football bar with hanging kettlebells. He believes this helps him build stabilization and hits his triceps very well. Another one of his favorite triceps exercises is dumbbell extensions off his chest. When he does these, he tries to keep the dumbbells touching and use nothing but triceps. This is one of his personal tests to see where he is in his bench. He knows if he can do 120-pound dumbbells strictly for 3 sets of 10-12 reps, his lockout should be strong and well over the 800-pound range.\nOne of his favorite max effort exercises is benching off of foam blocks. When he does this, the weight comes real close to, if not touching, his chest and clears the foam blocks by about 2 inches at lockout. This usually gives him a good idea of what he can lock out in a bench shirt. For example, when he did his first 830-pound bench press at a meet, he did 815 pounds off of the foam blocks. He did 855 pounds in the gym in a bench shirt.\nHe always tries to set personal markers to tell where he is on his bench. His favorite is when he is warming up, he goes up to 500 pounds in a t-shirt full range. He knows if it goes up easy, it should be a very good bench day. If it is slow or sluggish, it is probably not going to be a very good day. The last workout prior to going to a meet he tries to pick something like a floor press and goes up to the 500-pound mark with straight weight. If it feels bad or slow, it usually tells him that training has been good and he should be healed and ready to compete by meet time. If it feels good, it’s a good guess that he is peaking at the wrong time.\nFor both workouts, on max effort and speed day, he tries to do at least three triceps isolation exercises. He usually does 3 sets of 10-12 reps per set on these exercises. After he is done doing these triceps exercises, he does a triceps burnout usually on the lat machine with a push-down bar; he tries to do 40-100 reps depending on the weight. If he is using a bar, he moves his grip every 10 reps.\nFor a typical speed workout, he does 8 sets of 3 benches. Next he does 3 sets of 10 skull crushers, then 3 sets of 10 triceps extensions. Sometimes he does push-downs on the dip machine. He normally increases the reps to 15-20 and still does 3 sets. Then he would be burned out on triceps. Next he would do some shrugs, different delt work, light pecs, and biceps. This would be a basic speed day or max effort day. He tries to never repeat exercises twice in one week. Occasionally for volume he will do a cycle after speed sets at maximum reps with straight weight starting at 315 the first week, 365 the second week, 405 the third week, 455 the fourth week, and 495 the last week. Next up is Mike Wolfe, a bench-only SHW with an 859-pound bench. His speed day is 225 pounds with a mini or monster mini or light bands much like Tony’s. Both have a 600-pound raw bench. Mike likes 9 sets of 3 reps, with 3 sets with the index finger touching the smooth, 3 sets 2 inches out from the smooth and 3 sets with the little finger touching the ring. After speed benching he will do 2 sets of dumbbell presses with a moderate weight or 100 or 110 pounds for 15 reps, then do triceps extensions. Mike likes dumbbell roll-backs and extensions with the elbows out to the side. Mike uses 125 pounds for a lot of his dumbbell extensions. You have to have a strong upper back to handle 800 pounds in the bench. Lots of rows with dumbbells or a barbell, chest-supported rows, and low-pulley rows are rotated in and out during the weeks of training. Shrugs, side and rear delt work, and hammer curls round out the speed day.\nOn max effort day some of Mike’s favorite exercises are raw two- and three-board press, two- and one-board presses with a shirt, reverse band press with and without a bench shirt, max 6-rep ultrawide benches, and heavy dumbbell pressing. Mike has undergone a huge weight loss from 420 pounds to 255 pounds bodyweight. So the next chapter is yet to be written for Mike.\nDave Hoff has a 2615 total at 260 pounds bodyweight, a 1005-pound squat at 19 years old and 252 pounds bodyweight, and an 825-pound bench at 262 pounds bodyweight. On speed day he does 205-275 pounds for 9 sets of 3 reps using the three grips Mike Wolfe uses. The band tension ranges from 85 with mini-bands to 125 with monster mini-bands and 200 pounds with light bands, and he also will use 120 pounds of chains on occasion. A lot of work on speed day is with the football bar, with the palms-facing-in grip and a lot of board presses on boards. A lot of rep work is done with kettlebells hanging under a special bar that vibrates or a regular bench bar for no less than 10 reps. He does a lot of dumbbell extension roll-backs and with elbows out to the sides and shrugs for the upper back and side and rear delt raises. He finishes with hammer curls.\nOn max effort day he does a lot of board presses with close grip and no shirt or regular grip with a shirt, rack lockouts on high pins with a 6-8 inch lockout, lightened method benches and floor presses with 200 pounds of chains, and a large amount of upper back work three times a week to support those 800-pound-plus benches and his 800-pound pulls. He constantly changes special exercises. I believe he will bench 900 pounds in a full meet in two years’ time.\nGreg Panora, who totaled 2630 at 242 pounds bodyweight, has a world record total. He also pulled an 815-pound deadlift. His speed day is very similar to Dave’s. Both raw bench around 550 pounds. Greg does a lot of his speed work wearing a 10-pound weight on his wrists. He does 9 sets of 3 reps with three grips. The weight is 225 to 275 depending on the amount of chains or band tension he is using. After speed sets he does a wide- and close-grip bench for 15-20 reps. The weight may range from 185 to 250 pounds. This cannot be done at the end of a workout. Next he does triceps extensions with a football bar. The reps are 5-8 per set, sometimes supersetted with light push-downs on a lat machine or a Jump-Stretch band hung over the squat rack. He also does front plate raise, light for high reps, lots of heavy shrugs, incline and decline dumbbells for delt and chest development, and always hammer curls. He continually changes all small exercises when necessary for further progress.\nOn max effort day his favorite core lifts are floor press with chains or band tension, board press (two or three boards without shirt and one and a ½ boards with a shirt), and some heavy close grips with a 2-inch foam pad on the chest. About 2 ½ years ago Greg had a 600-pound bench and a 2255-pound total. What’s in the future for Greg? Time will tell.\nJason (Jay) Fry has broken the 181 all-time record twice with 707 and 725 pounds. He has now made 750 pounds at 181 and is in hot pursuit of Jason Coker’s 771 pounds. Jay’s best is 770 pounds at 198 pounds bodyweight. He has jumped 250 pounds in three years. Here’s how: On speed day he does 9 sets of 3 reps with 205 pounds plus bands, chains, or both, with three grips, like many at Westside. After the speed work Jay will do 2 sets of push-ups with his feet elevated or 2 sets of moderate dumbbell presses, each week changing the angle from flat, seated, incline, or decline, and lots of upper back and lat work. For his triceps Jay does triceps extensions of all kinds, dumbbells, barbells, push downs, and also board presses with and without a bench shirt. And speaking of bench shirts, Jay will use a variety of shirts to do his board presses and full-range benching, unlike many who break world record board presses but can’t touch their chest when it counts at a meet. For his max effort work his favorite is floor press of some kind. He also does lightened method, board presses, incline barbell press with a close grip, and foam pressing.\nTravis Bell shares his workouts that have taken his bench from 780 to 765 at 260 pounds bodyweight and his raw bench from 430 to 540 pounds in about two years: Speed Bench\nBar x warmup\nAdd doubled mini-bands or monster mini-bands\nBar x 3 reps 135 x 3 – start using close grip, index finger on the smooth\n185 x 3\n205 x 3\n205 x 3\n225 x 3 – start using moderate close grip, thumb length from the smooth\n225 x 3\n225 x 3\n275 x 3 – pinkie on the ring or competition grip\n275 x 3\n275 x 3\nFloor Press (for accessory)\nall sets done with close grip\n225 x 10 reps\n315 x 10\n315 x 10\n365 x 10\nDumbbell Press\n120 x 15 reps\n120 x 15\n120 x 15\n120 x 15\nPulldowns with the Back Bar\n160 x 12 reps\n200 x 12\n230 x 12\n230 x 12\nChest-Supported Rows\n2 plates x 12 reps\n3 plates x 12\n4 plates x 10\n4 plates x 10\nHammer Curls\n45 x 10\n45 x 10\n45 x 10\n45 x 10\nThis is what a normal speed bench session looks like for Travis. The speed training really helps him develop momentum in a bench shirt. Teaching your muscles to fire as quickly as possible and all at the same time is imperative. The other thing that he feels helps his bench the most is floor press. I asked George Halbert a long time ago what the best thing to do to get his floor press up is, and he said close-grip floor press for reps. Floor press greatly helps him develop mid-range power. Many people think of the floor press as a max effort exercise, but forget to use it as an accessory exercise. The second thing is lots of upper back work. Upper back strength helps him maintain the position of his shoulder blades at the bottom of the lift. When your shoulders come out of position, it changes what angle your elbows are at in relation to the bar, as well as increasing your range of motion because you are flattening out.\nFor his max effort day Travis will rotate from floor press with 200 pounds of chains to full-range or two- or 3-board pressing with 200 pounds of band tension, lightened method with 150 pounds or 95 pounds lightened in the bottom, lots of close-grip benching off his chest or off power rack pins, plus dumbbell pressing of all kinds. He does upper back work three times a week and triceps extensions of all kinds, sometimes supersetting light push-downs for 15 reps with barbell or dumbbell extensions for 5-8 reps. He always does some hammer curls. What’s next? 800 pounds I am sure.\nLaura Phelps-Sweatt benches 505 pounds at 165 pounds bodyweight, which is unbelievable. How does she do it? Let’s look at her speed day. Laura’s raw bench is 335 pounds, so her speed work is 165 pounds plus mini-bands or two sets of chains for 9 sets of 3 reps, 3 sets with index finger touching the smooth part of the bar and 3 sets with little finger touching the power ring. She rotates from doing 2 sets of moderate dumbbells for 15 reps to 2 sets of push-ups for 30-50 reps and sometimes one close grip and one wide grip set of benches for an easy 15 reps. Then she does lots of dumbbell extension roll-backs or with elbows out to the side. She works upper back at least three times a week. Laura is the world record holder in the squat and total in two weight classes, so the upper back work is a must. Rear and side delt work of all kinds is done in both bench workouts. For max effort work some of her future exercises are the lightened method with 200 pounds of chains for lockout strength in a shirt, bands over the bar on boards or chest with a shirt, total weight at lockout close to 600 pounds, the same two exercises without shirts, and floor press with 120 pounds of chains.\nAll of Westside max effort exercises are done at some time during the year. Laura has the number 1 coefficient in the bench and the total for women. Many of our top benchers at Westside are or were full powerlifters. All have at least an Elite total. The system will work for everyone, and all you have to do is follow the 2 days that wave every 72 hours from low intensity, high volume on the speed day, to low volume, high intensity, which is hopefully over 100% or a new all-time record. John Stafford had the all-time push-pull total, and now Greg Panora does, with 805 and 815 pounds, respectively, at 242 pounds bodyweight. It’s tough to compete with a bench specialist, but we try and so can you.\nLouie Simmons",

It builds strong legs and hips which helps in all sports, but of course, is an official power lift. The squat is the first lift contested and sets the tone for the rest of the meet. Without gear, when the squat goes up so does the pulls, power clean, power snatch and of course deadlift. There are many forms of squatting. You can do both front and back squats. With technology, we have a Zercher squat harness, Bow Bar which has a 2” camber, a rackable cambered bar and a safety squat bar. The safety squat bar is also cambered when sitting on your back, Olympic style squat where the bar sits high on back and feet close together. A manta ray squat device sits higher on the back. My experience is all of these devises aid the deadlift more than the squat. Belt squatting will build the leg muscles and save the back, plus acts as a traction device correcting pelvic tilt. Our favorite is the box squat. They are done at parallel or below. No need to do high box squatting when using jump stretch bands or chains. When box squatting, there is one way to do this and one way only. Box squatting causes one to relax then overcome the load dynamically, as well as the static load dynamically at the same time. Both are great for explosive and absolute strength. They are the safest squat because they are a leg curl to separate from the box. Now the methods used at Westside, let’s start on squat day which is on Friday. Here, we rotate three methods which are the dynamic method, the circamax method and occasionally the max effort method. All are followed by the repetition method with special exercises. The Friday squat workouts should use a squat bar. We use the Mastodon squat bar sold exclusively at Elite Fitness by my good friend Dave Tate. Other style bars can distort squatting form. They are to be used on max effort day which is 72 hours later or on Monday. First, the dynamic effort method will build a fast rate of force development and not absolute strength. This is because of the explosive strength deficit. The percents are up to 70% of a 1 rep max. This method is very important for sports and jumping development. We know the strongest lifter handles most weight and most often. So lets look how a powerlifter should train most of the year. Let’s look at a 9 week cycle of dynamic efforts. The laws of physical training must be utilized one such law is continuous training. The percents should range from 55% to 68%. Each week move up 5% for a three week wave. Then, add more accommodating resistance with jump stretch bands or by adding chains.\nThis is for a 9 week dynamic cycle for 800 lbs squat with contest gear. For training, use strong briefs plus a suit down with no straps. 1. 405 x 12 sets of 2 reps; 2 sets of chains\n2. 445 x 12 sets of 2 reps; 2 sets of chains\n3. 480 x 10 sets of 2 reps; 2 sets of chains\n4. 405 x 12 sets of 2 reps; 3 sets of chains\n5. 445 x 12 sets of 2 reps; 3 sets of chains\n6. 480 x 10 sets of 2 reps; 3 sets of chains\n7. 405 x 12 sets of 2 reps; 4 sets of chains\n8. 445 x 12 sets of 2 reps; 4 sets of chains\n9. 480 x 10 sets of 2 reps; 4 sets of chains\nBecause we box squat and have a box squat max which should be about 700 box max for an 800 contest squat that is how we arrive at these approximate percents. If no gear is used, it would represent 50-60% of a 1 rep max. By changing the type of accommodating resistance we can avoid the law of accommodation. This means by definition that a decrease in response of a biological object to continued stimulus (Zatsiorsky). Let’s look at a second dynamic method that is used to a large extent. A 1000 lbs squatter would use a combination of band tension which equals 25% of 1000 lbs at the top. Let’s not forget the virtual force effect. This is when the lifter comes in contact with the box at an over speed eccentric phase imposed by the downward pressure of the band tension. When velocity is increased so is kinetic energy.\nWeek 1- 400 on a bar plus 250 band tension 10×2\nWeek 2- 450 on a bar plus 250 band tension 10×2\nWeek 3- 500 on a bar plus 250 band tension 10×2\nWeek 4-550 on a bar plus 250 band tension 8×2\nWeek 5-600 on a bar plus 250 band tension 8×2\nThe bar weight is waved from 40% to 60% plus 25% added at the top. A third cycle is the future method. The band is attached at the top of the power rack and reduces the load in the bottom of the lift. This is great for the intermediate lifters or ball players. 600 lbs max squat workout would look like this. The first 3 week wave is with light jump stretch bands® that unloads the bar 65 lbs in the bottom, the second 3 week wave uses an average jump stretch band® that unloads 95 lbs in the bottom. The third 3 week wave uses a strong jump stretch bands®. This means use 65 lbs over 50% the first week, 95 lbs the second week and 155 lbs on the third week of each wave. 600 Max\nWeek 1-365 for 12 sets of 2 reps; 300 plus 65 lbs contrast\nWeek 2-425 for 12 sets of 2 reps; 330 plus 95 lbs contrast\nWeek 3-515 for 8 sets of 2 reps; 360 plus 155 contrast\nWeek 4-6 Repeat a 3 week wave add 2 sets of 5/8” chains\nWeek 7-9 Repeat a 3 week wave plus 3 sets of 5/8” chains\nNote to remember: Complete 50% and add 65 lbs on the bar as that is what is unloaded with the light bands. Add 95 lbs to 55% as that amount is unloaded with average bands. On the third week wave at 60% add 155 lbs of additional bar weight to replace the unloading in the bottom.We have covered 23 weeks of squatting. Of course it can vary with other types of strength development. One such strength is strength speed or slow strength. This will build absolute strength. To do this method use an equal or greater amount of band tension versus bar weight. The bands will slow the concentric phase greatly by accommodating resistance to a massive degree. So, at Westside we have made 600 lbs bar weight and 600 lbs of band tension. The eccentric phase is controlled to roughly .5 m/s. This should duplicate the speed on a top squat poundage on contest day. This cycle should not last longer than two weeks. Following the regimentation of A.S. Prilepins do no less than 4 and no more than 10 lifts with weights above 90%. An 800 lbs squat strength speed cycle:\nWeek 1-Add 440 lbs of band tension and do 365×2 reps\n385×2 reps\n405×2 reps\n425×1 rep\nWeek 2\n365×2 reps\n405×2 reps\n430×1 rep\n450×1 rep\nAs you can see by adding the 440 lbs of jump stretch bands® this referred to as the weight lifting methods. This is where 1 or 2 reps are used for repeated sets at near or max effort.\nWe have now discussed 25 weeks of squat workouts. The most important cycle is of course the contest cycle. It is preceded by 1 or 2 weeks speed or dynamic work. The contest cycle at Westside is known as the circa-max method. The last 2 weeks followed by a deload week the week before a meet. It is much like the strength speed phase but with a less amount of band tension.\nA 1000 squat cycle\nThis is not hypothetical based on a current 1000 lbs squat\nWeek 1\n420×2 reps plus 440 band tension\n470×2 reps plus 440 band tension\n520×2 reps plus 440 band tension\n570×1 rep plus 440 band tension\nWeek 2\n470×2 reps plus 440 band tension\n520×2 reps plus 440 band tension580x1 rep plus 440 band tension\n610×1 rep plus 440 band tension P.R.\nWeek 3- 500×3 sets of 2 reps plus 200 lbs of band tension\nWeek 4-Contest\nSince we started this system, first proven by the former Soviet Union weight lifters man across the world have duplicated the system with great success. The more weight used for box squatting the more gear can be used. When using bands correctly the tension in the bottom should be great. This will cause the eccentric phase to be at a greater speed than normal. At the contest with the 2 ply gear rule, the eccentric phase at the contest can be very slow. To no disturb your timing use your contest gear suit and briefs but not straps or knee wraps. I hope the notes about squatting can help you on your quest to the top.\nLouie Simmons",

      "pageContent": "DEADLIFTING Louie Simmons Tue Oct 18, 2016 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shopifycloud/shopify/assets/no-image-2048-5e88c1b20e087fb7bbe9a3771824e743c244f437e4f8ba93bbf7b11b53f7824c_720x.gif\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"\"> Related Topics: Conjugate Method, Exercise Programming, Louie Simmons, Strength Training Methods Westside has 15 members who deadlift more than 800 pounds, six women who have done more than 500 pounds, and one, M. Liggett, who deadlifed 484 at 132 body weight. I have found a common denominator for deadlifting success: the proper selection of special exercises. Let’s start with special squatting.\nSafety Squat Bar. This bar plays a large role in our deadlifting. Use a narrow squat stance and a box of 4 inches lower than your regular box that you use to train the squat. Work up to a 5- or 3-rep or single box record. The Safety Squat bar will overload the back, hip, and leg muscles, resulting in a stronger deadlift. One can use a very wide stance and very low box for more hip development. As a bonus, it increases your flexibility for your sumo pulls. Good mornings with the Safety Squat bar are tremendous for the deadlift as well. We use three varieties. One is the regular good morning standing up with bent or straight legs in an arched or bent-over back position. A second method is with the bar suspended by chains at a variety of heights, or placing the bar on power rack pins of your choice. Hold on to the bar yolks at all times. The third method consists in turning the bar around. It works completely differently this way. Try it.\nFront Squat. This is a second type of special squatting. For the front squat you want to use a front squat harness if you can. Many great pullers used the front squat for deadlifting. Eddie Copplin, who pulled 826 at 186 BWT, was one. We use a low box, as for the Safety Squat bar squats. Sometimes we sit on a foam box for more leg strength, using both wide and close stance. For the individuals who wear Chuck Taylors like myself, try using a weight lifting shoe with a heel occasionally, to really feel it in the legs. I would have Olympic lifters do box squats like Westsiders to raise their front squat. We do front squats to raise our squat and deadlift.\nZercher Squat. Ed Zercher came up with this squat variety many years ago. In 1966 or 1967, I read about a prisoner by the name of Robert Barnett, who had just pulled a 675 deadlift at 165 BWT. He related that the Zercher squat was responsible for his success. He reported that his best was 395 x 5 reps done off the floor. The article also said that Alexander Karelin, the famous Soviet wrestler, had done 440 for 5 reps while visiting Finland. I was sold on this exercise and have been doing them for years. I found them tough right after my right bicep tendon rupture in 1979. I finally came up with a device called the Zercher harness, to take the pressure off the biceps. Our deadlifts started going up again when we added heavy Zerchers into the rotating program. Thanks, Ed Zercher, wherever you are.\nI have talked about squatting for the deadlifts so what about deadlifts? We do several special deadlifts with band resistance.\nSpeed Pulls with Mini Jump-Stretch Bands. The tension at the bottom is 100 pounds and 220 pounds at lockout. Do 5-10 singles for dynamic work. I made 535 pounds bar weight plus mini-bands and made a 715-pound deadlift at 217 BWT. The top weight with bands was 755; 415 pounds with two sets of Jump-Stretch mini-bands, which doubles the tension, will yield a 700-pound deadlift.\nTom Eiseman came to Westside for a visit and pulled 505 bar weight plus monster mini Jump-Stretch bands that produce 280 pounds of tension at the top. The bands and the bar together equal 785 at the top, very close to his best official pull. We have several examples that are similar. My speed work for the 715-pound pull was 345 plus 220 pounds of tension at the top with the mini-bands. We will add more band tension at lockout by placing a light, medium, or strong band over the bar but not doubled up. This builds a tremendous lockout. It also develops a very fast start. After one such pull, your brain will understand what physical demands you are placing on it.\nRack Pulls. Rack pulls are as old as Milo, but we put a new twist on them. We quadruple-up mini-bands for up to 600 pounds max. Monster mini-bands are used by up to 800-pound pullers. Sometimes light Jump-Stretch bands are used to slow the pulls from start to finish. When Chuck Vogelpohl trained here, I asked him what he thought the rack pulls with bands taught him. He replied that they teach him to think while pulling, instead of pulling wildly in the wrong direction.\nDeadlifts without Band Tension. Years ago, John Smith of Australia wrote an article about straight-leg sumo pulls. I decided to do an experiment with Tim Harold, a former Westsider. His best official pull was 700 pounds conventional. Because he is 6’ 7” tall, we placed 6-inch collars on the bar before adding plates. With a max stance Tim worked on this style. His pulls were with legs bent as much as the stance would allow. In a 1 ½ year span his conventional pull went to an official 825 pounds and an official 855-pound sumo. That is a 155-pound increase in his meet deadlift. While this has been the most dramatic increase, others have made substantial gains.\nStraight-Leg Sumo-Style Deadlift. Last on our list is this exercise from John Smith. Use as wide a stance as possible and keep the back fully arched. This will place the shoulders very far in front of the bar. Keep the back arched fully. While this places great stress on the hamstrings and lower back, it is perfectly safe. Greg Panora made 685 pounds for 3 paused reps and deadlifted 815 pounds at the next meet.\nAfter reaching your near potential in the deadlift, it is very hard to increase it. But I feel most lifters never reach their real potential. Why? You can buy a better bench with a bench shirt and a better squat with a squat suit, but you have to really train to be a good deadlifter. I was amazed to witness Andy Bolton pull a 1003 deadlift, and now he has done 1008 pounds. I am 61 years old and did not think I would live long enough to see a 1000-pound deadlift.\nThe methods I have discussed will help you reach your ultimate goal. Some other tips are to make sure your abs are very strong. After all, you flex the abs first, I hope. Of course, the lower back has to be armor-proof as well. We have found that the hamstrings, when weak, get injured, but when they are strong, they hold all you can put on them. I am sure you know what I am talking about. These exercises are the key for football players as well. They build the posterior chain. Many talk about the posterior chain, but don’t have a clue how to build it safely. There used to be a saying, and a true one, that went like this, “The meet does not start until the bar touches the floor.” But that was before you could get 300 pounds out of your bench shirt.\nLouie Simmons",

Maximal effort method: lifting a maximal load against a maximal resistance.2. Repetition method: lifting a nonmaximal load to failure; during the final repetitions, the muscles develop the maximum force possible in a fatigued state.3. Dynamic effort: lifting a nonmaximal load with maximal speed.\n(See: Science and Practice of Strength Training, V. Zatsiorsky.)\nThe max effort method is superior to the other common methods. It improves intermuscular and intramuscular coordination, because the body will adapt to only the stimulus placed upon it. The max effort method will produce the greatest strength gains. While it is not uncommon to suffer fatigue, high blood pressure at rest, anxiety, and depression from using this method, it is the most popular among top athletes and lifters. It should not be used for small exercises but for the clean, snatch, squat, bench, and deadlift.\nThe old Soviet Union used it and Westside Barbell uses it for special exercises such as good mornings, box squats, rack pulls, and many forms of squatting. Because the body muscular system and the CNS adapt quickly, we do a new exercise each week to avoid accommodation. The core exercises must be close in biomechanical parameters to the classical lifts, power or Olympic. Doctor Squat said it best, “If light weights make you strong, why not lift just light weights?” Of course we know he was right, and that’s why the max effort method works best.\nHill determined that the speed of movement is dependent on maximum muscular strength. Did you hear that, football strength coaches? Physics states that maximum force is attained when velocity is small. Consequently, maximum velocity is attained when external resistance is near zero (Theory and Practice of Physical Culture). Why do I bring this up? Do you want to be faster and stronger?\nA study in Strength and Power in Sport by P. Komi showed the greatest weightlifters in the world lifted the heaviest weights the slowest. This simply shows it is better to have a high level of strength over speed. I have been using this system at Westside since 1983. I started talking about the books I was learning from by Bud Charniga, who had translated them from Russian. Many have read some of the books, but have not considered the number of lifts, or the percentages that are determined with the Olympic lifts. This will not work with the power lifts.\nOlympic lifts have a bar speed of 1.2 to 1.4 meters per second (mps) in the first pull. A second pull of 2.2 mps can be attained. Top powerlifts are 0.5 to 0.7 mps. Olympic lifting is primarily a speed strength sport. The time under tension is brief. The powerlifts are quite a different story. It is a strength speed or slow strength sport. This means the training percentages would be somewhat higher. Even Olympic lifts are seldom less than 70% of a one-rep max.\nStatistics that showed the breakdown of Olympic lifts by percents of a one-rep max showed the distributions of loads as follows:\n49.5% of the lifts are from 75% to 85%\n27.1% of the lifts are above 85%\nRemember, this is based on Olympic lifts, which are much faster than powerlifts. While max force production occurs at 4 tenths of a second, you must maintain it until the lift is complete. As mentioned, 85% of a one-rep max is used the most, so we try to wave from 75% to 85% in three-week waves. Only 23.4% of the lifts are performed at 70% or below of a one-rep max. These statistics were based on 780 highly qualified weightlifters. The study was done by A. D. Ermakov and N. S. Atanasov in 1975.\nThe Westside max effort method is a combination of the Bulgarian system, the former Soviet Union system, and my 43 years of powerlifting with over 85 Elite powerlifters. There are all body types in powerlifting, as you well know. The Soviet Union was very vast geographically, leading to different body types and ethnic groups to choose from. This means they used a lot of exercises to develop their lifters’ shortcomings. Sounds just like Westside.\nIn the book Strength and Power in Sport by P. Komi, A. Vorobyev states that the Soviet team would do 20,000 lifts, classical and special combined, per year. Of those, 600 were maximal lifts (new records). The lifters were chosen after a three-year preparatory phase of base work was performed to ensure they were suited to handle the work loads, physical and psychologically. This is known as the “rule of three”. The Soviet weightlifters were more diversified than their Bulgarian counterparts.\nWhile the Soviet team was tremendous, the Bulgarian team was amazing, under coach Ivan Abadjiev. The Bulgarian team would choose only model weightlifters, meaning they fit the height and weight index. Bulgaria is about the size of Ohio. Both the junior and senior national teams trained together under a few coaches led tightly by Abadjiev. It was his way or no way. If a lifter could not handle the stress of constantly using max or near-max lifts, they were replaced, whereas the Soviet team did two workouts a day, which were composed of pulls, good mornings, and squats.\nWestside also trains two times a day; the difference is the second workout, which is directed toward a specific body part or parts, such as low back, lats, and abs or triceps, traps, and hammer curls. The Bulgarian coach, Abadjiev, chose to limit the training to six lifts: power snatch, snatch, power clean, clean and jerk, and front and back squat. After warming up they would do 6 max singles in the power snatch or snatch. This was done in 45 minutes to keep testosterone levels as high as possible. Then, they took a 30-minute rest and then did power clean and jerks, clean and jerks, or front or back squats. This amounts to 18 near-max lifts that are done every day, one in the morning session, again in the afternoon, and the third one in the evening. This added up to 18 near-max lifts in one day. The pulls and squats were trained this way all the time. Remember, they were very select in choosing the lifters who could handle the stress of training like this 6 days a week plus formally structured training on good mornings and back squats. Their system is what I based our max effort days on.\nMax effort days are lifting as heavy as possible depending on the lifter’s capabilities at the present time. This means that even though you may not be going to a contest, you are training like the lifters that are. Let’s look at the two systems. The majority of the Soviet training was centered around 75-85% of a one-rep max for about 50% of all lifts, and 20% are done at 90-100%. The Bulgarians trained mostly at 90-100% max. Circa-max weights are 90-97%. The Bulgarian system produced the highest results in weightlifting. Why? They handled the highest average weights most often. It’s that simple. Yes, they had used a very select group of lifters, but that system was the best.\nI had the pleasure of spending a day at Westside with a former Bulgarian weightlifting team doctor. He said many could not perform the tasks asked of the lifters. More times than not, it was the psychological stress and not the physical demands that stopped the lifter’s progress. I have seen the same at Westside. Handling weights above 90% for 3 weeks in the classical lifts can cause a lack of progress from accommodation or not varying the routine. At Westside, we change the max effort lift each week. This avoids the staleness syndrome, by doing exercises that are similar to but not actually the regular squat, bench press, and deadlift.\nWestside has developed a system of maxing out on nonclassical lifts. This allows us to eliminate the negative responses of training close to a maximum competition weight. The same negative response can occur with the special lifts Westside uses to max out on if we repeated the same lift each week. But remember we switch lifts every week to avoid this. You must remember the muscles and CNS adapt only to the load placed upon them. Zatsiorsky states that the maximal effort method brings forth the greatest strength increments, and CNS inhibition, if it exists, is reduced with this approach.\nNow we know that the max effort method is superior to others. One must train at the highest average of a one-rep max as often as possible. I realized for most lifters this is impossible to do every workout. That’s why we use the dynamic effort method. We use sub-maximal weights with maximal speed. Our squat training is mostly around 75-85% for multiple sets with briefs and a belt. Remember what Doctor Squat said? “If light weights work, why not use light weights?” But they don’t.\nWhen Chuck Vogelpohl trained at Westside, he handled the heaviest average weights when he squatted and deadlifted. He was our best squatter, setting world records in the 220 and 275 weight classes and now at 242 in a different gym. Now Greg Panora handles the heaviest weights if you average the squat, bench press, and deadlift, and he has dominated the 242 world record total. Look at Big Iron and I am sure you will see the same.\nZatsiorsky states “It’s impossible to exert a large amount of force against a small mass.” Dr. Hatfield was right. The men and women who can recruit the most muscle units are the strongest. The maximal effort method does just that. The next best method is the circa-max method, which uses 90-97½ % of a one-rep max. The circa-max method differs in that it can include multiple sets of 1 or 2 reps per set up to 10 total lifts per workout. It is worth noting that the Bulgarians had great restoration methods, such as whirlpools, saunas, massage, and others at their disposal.\nYou seldom calculate weights under 70%. The Soviets’ and Westside training is very similar in that the squats and pulls are mostly in the 75% to 85% range on dynamic day and always working up to a current max on max effort day. Remember, some supportive gear is almost always worn. On dynamic bench day, the percent is very low, 40-50%, but no gear is worn and there are always bands or chains on the bar. When the dynamic method is used, the muscles are contracted very fast and forcefully. I would personally experience more soreness on speed day. The dynamic method was developed to replace a max effort day for those who could not handle two max effort workouts a week. This helped me in the early years (1983) to recover from a bad back injury. I could not handle two max effort lower and upper body workouts per week, so we changed over to the dynamic method to make one day a fast day, not a light day, and keep the heavy day, or max effort day, because we knew the heaviest weight lifted in the gym would materialize into meet records if done correctly.\nOn dynamic day, stay with the percent program. Use a suit with the straps down or briefs only. Train in a 3-week pendulum wave at 50-60% of a contest max. The following are examples:\n400 to 480 pounds training weight = 800 squat\n450 to 540 = 900 squat\n500 to 600 = 1000 squat\nAlso use chains or bands.\nThis is very systematic, but as you can see, with this mathematical formula the stronger squatter uses the heaviest weights; it’s that simple. So use the max effort method to set standards,.\nIn 1974 Prilepin carried out a series of experiments with high-level weightlifters. One group trained at 70% of a one-rep max. The second group used 80% of a one-rep max, and a third group used weights at 90% of a one-rep max based on his recommendations. His research found training at 90% was the most effective, 80% was the next best, and the least effective was the 70% weight. The conclusion was that training at the greater weights produced the most significant gains. Prilepin also found the best results regarding percents came from using an optimal number of lifts: 18 lifts at 70%, 15 lifts at 80%, and 7 lifts at 90%.\nWhile this article is about max effort, the other day is just as important. Prilepin also found that it was less fatiguing to do a higher number of sets and a lower number of reps. The reverse will lead to a distortion of technique. This was taken from the textbook Physical Culture Institutes by A. M. Vorobiev.\nI hope these examples have shown you what is truly important about building absolute strength. It is based on both the dynamic and max effort day. As Lelikov proved, muscle strength increases more in execution at moderate tempo, while the fast lifts gave the lowest increase in strength. If you are wondering about only the classical lifts, Medvedyev found the same to be true in special exercises as well when one becomes more proficient in the classical lifts (Weightlifting and Methods of Teaching).\nHopefully this information can help you reach the very top.\nLouie Simmons",

There are some who think it is not necessary to work on speed. This is just one part of the total strength equation.\nSometimes when people read a little, they become dangerous. A little knowledge can be a curse. One day a couple lifters and I were having a discussion about the training philosophies of Dr. Y. V. Verkhoshansky. I explained to them that Dr. Verkhoshansky is an expert on power metrics, or the entire collection of jumping, rebounding, and shock training. While some refer to me as a weight lifting expert, you can’t compare our methods at all. That’s when I knew not to loan a single book to anyone; it leads to confusion.\nLet’s look at the purpose of the dynamic method, or training with submaximal weights with maximal speed. This system builds a fast rate of force development. With bands and chains added, it teaches one to accelerate and reduce bar deceleration. With the lighter weights, one can control and perfect form.\nFor more explosive strength, one can do ballistic benching. This method consists in lowering the barbell as fast as possible and catching and reversing the bar just before it touches the chest. Do not allow the bar to touch the chest. Press the bar to lockout as powerfully as possible.\nThe dynamic method was also used to replace a maximal effort method™ for those who could not handle a second high-intensity, or 95% and above, workout twice a week. If you do two extremely heavy workouts a week, you can suffer the law of accommodation. This simply means, if you handle the same loads and same training percents, your performance will go backwards.\nI personally did this for 13 years, 1970 to 1983, and only after breaking my L5 vertebra twice did I invest in several books from the old Soviet Union translated by Bud Charniga Jr. My first positive training came from A. S. Prilepin’s charts explaining why one must use a certain percent of a 1-rep max, and how many lifts in one workout, at what percents, and the repetitions per set you should follow. This leads to why one must use the dynamic system in one form or another.\nA. S. Prilepin found that at 70% of a 1-rep max after 6 reps, the force production would decrease on the seventh repetition. At 80%, the fifth rep would slow down, and thus force production was reduced. At 90%, he recommended 1 to 2 reps only because the barbell again would slow on the third rep and power would diminish once again.\nWe use 3 reps for benching for the most part, but after a meet we use 5 reps for 10 sets. By doing this we alter the volume without changing the intensity. A 500-pound raw floor presser would use 200 pounds and two sets of 5/8-inch chain for the dynamic method. For 10 sets of 3 reps with bands or chains, the total volume without the accommodating resistance would be 6000 pounds. To reach a 505 personal record, the procedure would look like this:\nAfter a warmup start calculations at 70% of the 500 raw bench record.\n365 x 1405 x 1435 x 1470 x 1485 x 1505 x 1 PR\nThis is a total of 2665 pounds.\nThe intensity is >100%, and the important point is, the volume is roughly 50% of the dynamic day. This represents a spike in training or a wave during a weekly plan. The wave-like basic periodization system was first introduced by Matveyev in 1964.",

I realized I could only squat, bench, or deadlift so much by doing only those three lifts. I was using several pin levels, different box heights, and many forms of benching such as board pressing and floor pressing in the early 1970s. I found out early on that after 3 weeks of doing the same lift I regressed. That’s how the 3-week pendulum wave became a constant fixture at Westside.\nWestside max effort day is designed with the best of three systems. The Bulgarian max effort day is distinguished by lifting as heavy a weight as possible on that day. Their max effort day may not be the most ever lifted, but rather the heaviest weight possible on that day. They would concentrate on just a few lifts after mastering technique in the classical lifts. They were, remember, model athletes, built for their sport.\nThe former Soviet Union claims to have invented the conjugate method at a club known as the Dynamo Club. They had 70 highly ranked lifters and used 25 to 40 special exercises to complement the Olympic lifts. A study of this system showed that only one lifter was satisfied and the rest wanted more exercises to choose from. Many times they would do the heavy effort method. This means weight over 90% but not an ultimate record. This develops a higher total volume but less than 100% intensity. They would push the number of classic lifts near contest time and decrease special exercises.\nWestside’s conjugate method follows the Bulgarian system of maxing out on each max effort day. We want a new all-time record, not even 90% or 97½%, but something we have never done. Like the Soviet system, we use a multitude of special exercise during the weekly or monthly plan. Each week we use different exercises to max out on. We can train at 100%+ each week, year in and year out. Do you want to lift 1% under your best or 1% over your best? I feel this is superior to all other systems. It trains a lifter mentally, psychologically, and physically. In our training we are used to breaking new records each week, making it easy at contest time.\nHere are some examples of max effort workouts for the squat and deadlift.\n1. Light front squat for warm up; rack pulls with one pin for max single; 3 to 6 sets of glute/ham raises; 3 to 6 sets of low pulley 8 to 12 reps; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine; 8 to 12 reps of abs while standing up, as heavy as possible.\n2. 6 trips of sled pulls 60 yards with 2 to 4 45-pound plates; Safety Squat bar to max single on 12-inch high box; 3 sets of pull-through, high reps; 3 to 6 sets of chest-supported rows; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine, 8 to 12 reps; 3 to 6 sets of abs lying on a 6-inch roller.\n3. 3 sets of hanging leg raises as warm up; rack pulls with 350 pounds of band tension for max single; 3 to 6 sets of heavy shrugs, dumbbell or barbell; 3 to 6 sets of heavy Reverse Hyper machine; sled pulls, 8 trips of 60 yards with moderate weight; 3 sets of straight-leg sit-ups.\n4. Concentric good morning max 3 reps; 6 to 8 sets of belt squats heavy; 6 to 8 sets of dumbbell row; 3 sets of 45-degree back raise; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hypers; 3 to 6 sets of leg lifts with ankle weights.\n5. Box deadlift on 4-inch box max single; front squat, work up to 6-rep max; pull-through 4 sets; Ukrainian deadlifts 2 sets of 20 reps; low-pulley rows 3 to 6 sets heavy; 6 to 8 reps of 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine, heavy; straight-leg sit-ups with weights.\n6. 14-inch cambered bar off of a low foam box, 10 sets heavy; 4 to 6 45-pound plates sled pulls 60 yards; 4 sets of chest-supported rows heavy; 3 to 6 sets Reverse Hyper machine heavy; 6-inch foam roller sit-ups heavy.\n7. Max deadlift on floor with 280 pounds of band tension; 3 to 6 sets of belt squat heavy; barbell rows, 4 sets of 6 reps heavy; 4 to 6 sets of low-pulley rows heavy; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine heavy; 3 to 6 sets of heavy straight leg sit-ups.\n8. Zercher lift off of the floor to max single; 6 sets of sled pulls 4 to 6 45-pound plates; 3 sets of heavy dumbbell shrugs; 3 to 6 sets of chest-supported rows heavy; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine heavy; 3 to 6 sets of hanging leg raise with weight; walk ½ mile with 10-pound ankle weight and 50-pound weight vest.\n9. Safety squat bar with 300 to 450 pounds of band tension max single; 45-degree hyper for 6 sets heavy for 6 reps; 3 to 6 sets of low-pulley rows heavy; 3 to 6 sets of dumbbell rows heavy high reps; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine heavy; 3 to 6 sets of straight-leg sit-ups heavy; walk with wheel barrow heavy for ½ mile.\n10. Floor deadlifts plus 370 pounds of band tension for a max single; 2 sets of 20 reps Ukrainian deadlift; 6 sets for 60 yards sled pulls using 5 45-pound plates; 6 sets of dumbbell rows heavy 8 to 10 reps; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine heavy; 3 to 6 sets of 6-inch foam roller sit-ups heavy; 1 mile walk with 10-pound ankle weights.\n11. Low box squat on foam; 14-inch cambered bar to max; speed pulls 60% plus 220 pounds of band tension 8 singles; 45-degree back raise; 3 to 6 sets heavy plyo swing; 5 sets of 6 reps jumps; barbell rows 6 sets heavy; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine heavy; hanging leg raises with weight for 6 sets.\n12. Buffalo bar and good mornings for 5 sets of 5/8-inch chains to max 3 reps; 3 to 6 sets of glute/ham raises; 6 trips of sled pulls 60 yards; 5 45-pound plates dumbbells shrugs 3 to 6 sets of 10 reps; straight leg sit-ups 6 to 10 reps.\n13. Rack pulls with plates 6 inches off floor max; low-pulley rows 3 to 6 sets heavy; wheel barrow walk heavy 10 trips for 60 yards; Reverse Hyper machine 3 to 6 sets heavy; 6-inch foam roller sit-ups heavy.\n14. Box deadlift on 4-inch box max single; chest-supported rows 3 to 6 sets; 3 sets of Ukrainian deadlift 20 heavy reps; 3 to 6 sets of glute/ham raise heavy; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine heavy; 3 to 6 sets of hanging leg raises touching toes to bar.\n15. Heavy sled pulls 4 to 6 45-pound plates for 10 trips; front squat light for 6 sets on low box; low-pulley rows for 6 sets heavy; 3 to 6 sets of Reverse Hyper machine heavy; straight-leg sit-ups for 6 sets heavy.\nThese workouts can be arranged in any way you want. After the core exercise is done for a max single the selection of small exercises can also be mix and matched any way you want. The most advanced lifters should do 2 max effort and 1 squat workout or 1 squat and 2 max effort workouts. Remember that you have to back down on the fourth day. Friday is squat day, and max effort day is on Monday. Every 72 hours a high-volume or high-intensity workout can be done on either the bench training or the squat/deadlift training day.\nDuring the bench max effort day the volume must change from large to small, from dynamic effort on Sunday to max effort on Wednesday. A 500 bench lifter would do about 200 pounds plus mini bands for 10 sets. This is 6,000 pounds with low intensity or low percentage.\nOn max effort day, if you have a 500 floor press, you start at only 70% to calculate the weights. A lesser percent won’t contribute to max strength. A workout would look like this:\nWarm up to 315 for reps. Now add:365×1405×1435×1470×1485×1505×1 (personal record)\nThis is 2665 pounds.\nThe Olympic lifting rule of 60% is that one workout should be 60% volume of the most recent workout for the same muscle groups. In powerlifting the rule is 30% give or take 5%. Why? Powerlifting commonly jumps 50 or 90 pounds per set. Olympic lifters jump 11 or 22 pounds per set. This rule of 30 is true for benching or squatting workouts.\nLet’s look at some max effort workouts for the bench.\n1. Rack lockouts to max single; 2 sets of moderate dumbbell press flat; 6 to 8 sets of dumbbell triceps extension roll backs; 6 to 8 sets of chest-supported rows; 8 sets side and rear delt raise; hammer curl 3 to 4 sets.\n2. Floor press plus 200 pounds of chain, singles; 5 sets of low-pulley rows; 3 sets of dumbbell power cleans for 20 reps; 6 to 8 sets rear and side delts; hammer curls.\n3. Incline press to max single; light weight for 15 reps close and wide; dumbbell rows 6 to 8 reps sets heavy; face pulls high reps 2 sets; 6 sets straight bar triceps extension; hammer curls.\n4. 2-board press raw max single; 3 to 6 sets of dumbbell extensions with elbows out to side; 6 sets of lat pull-downs; dumbbell power cleans for 20 reps for 2 sets; hammer curls.\n5. Max bench with mini-bands; J.M. press 4 to 6 sets for 3 to 5 reps; 2 sets of dumbbell incline; low-pulley rows 4 to 8 sets heavy; rear and side delt raises; hammer curls.\n6.

Foam press to max single; 6 sets of dumbbell flat bench 10 to 15 reps; low-pulley rows 6 sets; dumbbell rows 6 sets; superset dumbbell roll back with light push-down; hammer curls.\n9. Floor press with monster minis to max; kettlebell press 6 sets of 10 to 15 rep max; dumbbell extensions with elbows out 8 sets of 8 reps; barbell rows 6 sets of wide grip; hammer curls.\n10. Pick a dumbbell 100, 125, or 150 pounds for a 3 set max rep, no less than 10 reps per set; lat pull-downs 8 sets; face pull 3 sets dumbbell power clean; 2 sets of 15 reps hammer curls.\n11. Future band press to max single; 2 sets of decline press with close grip and light weight for 20 reps; upright rows for 6 sets; hammer curls.\n12. 4-board press to max 3 reps; J.M. press, work up to max 3 reps; superset with light push-downs 15 reps; dumbbell power cleans 2 sets of 15 reps; low-pulley rows for 6 sets heavy; hammer curls.\nThree other max effort workouts will be with a bench shirt. Use a shirt about every 3 or 4 weeks. Last shirt workout is 3 weeks away from meet day. This comes to 15 max effort workouts to rotate in any system you want. You must after time make your own programs. No two people are totally alike, so some workouts will work better for one lifter than they do for another.\nAll the exercises I have discussed are similar to the classical lifts–squat, bench press, and deadlift–and will contribute to success in the contest lifts.\nThe Westside system makes it possible to lift a max each week all year long. I know of no other system that can do this. The Monday and Wednesday max effort days make one very strong. The speed days of Friday and Sunday make one very explosive, and all workouts with high volume make one very big through special exercises. This also helps you to perfect form by shoring up your weaknesses. What more can you ask for?\nLouie Simmons",

Olesia Lafina of Russia was the first to total ten times her bodyweight. Margaret Kirkland of Florida made ten times her bodyweight in two weight classes which were 105 and 114. Next up is Amy Weisberger of Westside Barbell. She total ten times bodyweight in the 132 and she holds the world record 1440 in the 148 class. Next women is Becca Swanson of Big Iron of Nebaska with Rick Hussey at the helm. She made lifts no one thought was possible for a women to make and even the men have a tough time doing them. Check this out. A 600 bench press, 856 squat and a 683 deadlift. I saw it. It was my pleasure and a distinct honor to have Becca represent the United States as the world’s strongest women bar none. Then, out of no where, comes Laura Phelps. She holds the squat records in the 165 at 740 lbs and at 181 770 lbs squat. At 181 she benched a world record of 465 lbs. Later on she made 455 and 465 at the Powerstation Pro-Am in at 165 bodyweight. Her total records at 165 bodyweight are 1715 and 1725 at 181 bodyweight. How did this all start? First, Laura was a gymnast for 14 years. Her flexibility is extraordinary. This aids in her later perfect form in all three lifts. After gymnastics she tried bodybuilding for a short time with good success but was bitten by the powerlifting bug. Most would like a virus like that. In the beginning her potential was obvious to all that saw her train. Her husband Shane guides all of her nutritional needs and it is beginning to show in her muscularity. She has traded fat for muscle really changing her body composition. Shane sets the diets for many M.M.A competitors and with his vast knowledge makes recovery and adding muscle mass very easy for Laura to only worry about herself and not other lifters. Laura and Shane set most of her training up with some small guidance from me with the Westside system. She rotates her squat workouts from chains to bands on a hard box to a foam box. The hand box builds connective tissues strength for explosiveness. The foam builds muscle and strength by slowing down the process. I can’t wait for schools to do studies on this subject with our recommendations. No more ranting, back to Laura.\nShe has squatted 640 in briefs and knee wraps. I wanted to take her to the Ohio State football facility but I don’t want to see kids cry. She uses her full gear about once a month to ensure she knows how to use it. She does a lot of belt squats, Reverse Hypers and pylo swing jumps making sure her abs are strong and to maintain her flexibility. She wears Leviathon squat suit and Rage X bench shirt from Inzer. For her bench she does speed work once a week and max effort work on Sunday. She always uses bands or chains on speed work to accommodate resistance. This is followed by two sets of moderate dumbbell presses on different angles that are switched each week. They are rotated with one set close and one set very wide bench on a flat, incline, decline just like the dumbbell press and done moderately for 5 to 8 reps per set. Then she does triceps work with barbells, dumbbells, sometimes super setting with light pushdowns for around 15 reps. Next, she does lat work of every kind possible with shrugs, rear and side delt work and that’s it.\nAfter max effort workouts the same two sets of light reps for muscle hypertrophy. Her main lifts are foam press, floor press, future method with several variations. They are intergraded with many forms of bands over the bar presses, dumbbell presses are very common in her workouts. She wears a shirt about half the max effort workouts and just like speed day Laura will do lots of triceps, lats upper back and rear and side delt work. She is constantly working on her bench form and flexibility. Shane has been working on Amy Weisberger’s bench style with great success. Now the deadlift training. She is very good at deadlifting having pulled 560 at 165. She will own that world record as well. She would windmill her pulls until I had her take an uneven stance with the under hand grip side by offsetting the foot spacing by two inches she no longer windmills. She does a lot of ultra wide sumo deadlifts which are done for her hip extensions and flexibility. She also does 45 degree hypers, Reverse Hypers, low pully rows and chest supported rows and shrugs with barbells and dumbbells. She does sled pulling for both squat and deadlifting which also aids in recovery and G.P.P. Glute ham raises, band leg curls and walking with ankle weights. Everyone must pass the test of time to be considered a great but I believe Laura will continue to blow everyone’s mind with her flawless form and immense strength combined with beauty and being one of the nicest, down to earth person you will ever meet. It is a true honor to have Laura on the Westside team. She represents us with integrity and strong values and a lasting commitment to her husband Shane her family and friends and Westside.\nIf anyone can challenge Laura at 165 or 181 I don’t see her running or retiring prematurely, but rather raising up to the challenge. She knows her place and it’s on top for some time to come. Long live the queen laura.\nLouie Simmons",

I am referring to the deadlift. Westside has 15 men who deadlift over 800 pounds. One man weighs 256 and is a mere 20 years old. Plus we have five women who have deadlifted 500 pounds or more. What type of training does it take to do this? Two types: hard and smart. We first analyze the lifter’s body structure. What exercises worked best for our former lifters with the same body proportions? Which muscle groups play a large role in deadlifting? Let’s start with some of our workouts. These are done on Monday, which is max effort day at Westside Workouts Stand on a 2- or 4-inch box with either a sumo or conventional style. This is intended to teach one to use more leg drive off the floor. Many will use too much back while standing on boxes; this is not what is intended, although it happens. Standing on boxes will build a strong start and also the finish but with pulling a longer distance. You will learn how much carryover will apply to your regular deadlift. I have witnessed lifters using rack pulls forever. I prefer to do rack work with the plates 2, 4, or 6 inches off the floor. My best official conventional deadlift was 722 pounds. My best rack pull 2 inches off the floor was 705 pounds. Many will do high rack pulls with 200 pounds more than they can pull off the floor. I think this is counterproductive. Chuck Vogelpohl would pull extremely heavy rack pulls, over 200 pounds more than his 835 deadlift. I asked him why he did them. He replied that it taught him to strain. I thought for a minute and said to myself, if anyone can strain, it’s him, but maybe that’s why he is so strong. So you choose, but remember, lifters that are great in a particular lift most of the times have a great structure for that lift. I feel that rack pulls with strong band tension over the bar work best. We use up to 350 pounds of band tension over the bar. A max deadlift can move very slowly, and rack pulls with band tension will teach one not only to strain but to think while straining maximally. Pulling off the floor with bands for speed works well and is done immediately after squatting. Here are some references. I used 345 pounds of bar weight plus 100 pounds band tension at the floor and 220 pounds at lockout. I also made 715 at a meet at 57 years old and 215 bodyweight. If one can pull 600 pounds with the same band tension, this will produce a 800-pound deadlift. Note: the 345 pounds was for 6-8 sets of 1 rep. The 600 pounds is a max single. This is the deadlift training we do at Westside. We deadlift at least once a week and sometimes twice. Special Exercises When we’re not deadlifting, we are doing good mornings or a form of squatting. Here are some examples of good mornings.\n1. Good mornings with straight legs and back arched 2. With legs bent and back arched 3. With legs bent and back rounded 4. With legs straight and back rounded 5. With toes or heels elevated: this stresses the lower back and hamstrings 6. Walking good mornings: bend over while stepping forward for a predetermined distance 7. Back Attack, which is a good morning machine 8. Concentric good mornings with different bars starting from the bottom and rising to completion. Note: we use a wide variety of bars when doing good mornings. Special Squats Special Squatting on Boxes. Low bar squat with a variety of bars; front squat; Manta Ray; Safety Squat bar; and cambered bar with a 2- to 14-inch camber. My all time favorite and I feel a major part of our success is the Zercher squat. These are done off the floor or in a rack with a wide or close stance. This exercise will build every muscle in the body. Special exercises Small Special Exercises. Belt squats, glute/ham raises, back raise, 45 degree back raise, Reverse Hypers, inverse curls, rowing of all kinds, shrugs, pulling a sled with weights, lots of abs, leg raises, sit-ups, standing abs, pull downs, and side bends. The hamstrings and abs are the most important muscle groups. If your hamstrings and abs are strong, your lower back will survive the rigors of training. Deadlift Form What is good form? Ask your doctor and he will tell you one thing, but remember your doctor does not know powerlifting. The safest method for an untrained person is not the best for a highly trained powerlifter. If you look at the greatest deadlifter of recent years they don’t appear to have a safe form. Vince Anello, John Kuc, and Brett Russell would pull with their heels close together almost stiff legged. Even many sumo pullers will round their backs to increase leverage. Jim Cash would push his knees inward while his feet were turned outward to prolong leg drive. Fred Hatfield, who was known for his squatting, pulled like an Olympic lifter at the start with a very straight back. Ed Coan would sumo but straighten his legs soon after the bar lifted off the floor. Mike Bridges, I felt, had an impeccable form with incredible strength. So what’s my point? If you train all muscles properly whatever your style, you will succeed if you can hold onto the bar. Mental Training I feel you must be positive, be confident in your ability, and lift within your ability. Don’t worry about others; make a plan and follow it. If you don’t have a plan, you plan to fail. References Book Of Methods - Louie Simmons\nSquat and Deadlift Manual - Louie Simmons",

There are a lot more misses than benches made. How can this be when all they do is bench? In my own gym at the last two meets the statistics are as follows. At the first only 1 of their 12 attempts was good. A week later four were good out of 22 attempts. How can someone who only benches be so inconsistent? I watch all workouts at Westside. I see what works and what does not. One group of bench-only lifters will use bench shirts every Sunday or max effort day. They work their way up in weight, as they use lower and lower board presses. For example, George Halbert made 870 off a halfinch board. At 198 Jason Fry made 700 off the same half-inch board. Two weeks later George missed 800 pounds at the very top, about 1/2 to 1 inch from lockout three times. Jason missed 700 pounds at the very same place. How can this be possible? By the way, they were 0 for 12 at that meet. For one thing, they seldom if ever touch their chest while training with bench shirts. They set the shirt to touch 3, 2, or 1 board. This is how they do an unheard-of number of board presses. We are not the only ones guilty of this. I know everyone practices the same methods. How can someone bench 870 a half-inch off his chest, yet fail to lock out 800 pounds at the meet? One reason I believe is the fact that after they do board work they go home. No lats, triceps, no nothing. The second reason is deceleration. If you can press with max force for 15 inches and you lower the bar to the chest, which is 1 or 2 inches lower than the board, for the first time, you may stop pushing 1 or 2 inches from lockout. Why else would your lockout disappear on the day of the meet? In physics, work is defined as the product of the net force and the displacement through which that force is exerted, or W = Fd. If you can run full speed for 100 feet and you move the starting line back 20 feet, you will stop running full speed 20 feet from the previous finish line. I watched a lifter miss 788 pounds at the top in the meet, yet lock out 855 pounds on two boards a week later. How many times do you see a lifter roll the bar onto his stomach at meet time? Madonna said it the best. “Like a virgin, touched for the very first time.” After months of training and almost never touching their chest, what do you expect? Jason Fry was having trouble at meets either touching the chest or locking out. I suggested he replace his shirt that he was breaking board press records with and use a more manageable shirt for the meet. Jason changed from a 47 double Rage X to a 49 double Rage and set the 181 bench record with 707 pounds. Congratulations Jason. I am in no way responsible for Jason’s record; his hard work and better judgment was the key. A second key was to bring up his raw strength. I saw him do a 405 raw bench like an empty bar in the warm-up room before his world record 707 -pound bench. I suggest doing board presses raw before going to board presses with a shirt. Jesse Kellum reintroduced board pressing to me back in 1993. Then through my articles in Powerlifting USA everyone started doing them, but I think they lost track why we do them. Remember, your arms have to extend to lock out, right? Then it makes sense to do extensions: rollback dumbbell extensions with your elbows out to the sides and triceps extensions. The late, great Jim Williams made them popular in the early 197 Os, and they still work. Sometimes we use bands behind the back to do them, with a straight bar or curl bar, or triceps extensions to the forehead, nose, chin, or throat. J. M. presses were a favorite of mine, as well as very steep inclines with a close grip. This one kills the triceps. I can go on and on, but you know a lot of exercises for the triceps. George Halbert has said if your upper back is weak, you can’t use your triceps to the fullest. Chins, rows, power cleans, face pulls, rear pec deck, and inverted flys can be used. You cannot let your raw bench go down when you continuously use a stronger and stronger shirt; it’s a dead-end street. Remember to use a manageable shirt. What happened to getting 300 pounds out of your shirt? Push your raw bench with a bar or dumbbells; don’t forget to try all angles and switch them regularly. It’s not only Westside that has this problem. The next time you go to a bench meet keep track of how many attempts are good compared to how many are not. I am in no way criticizing but analyzing the problem. Westside has held world records at 132 (Heath), 181 (Fry), 198 (Halbert), 220 (Halbert), 242 (Halbert), 275 (Patterson), and 308 (Fusner). This shows that we have been very successful, but there is a lot of competition out there. With two 198 full powerlifters out there doing 800+ benches (Frankl and Coker) at 198, can anyone take it easy? I don’t think so. Louie Simmons",

It’s that simple. But how do you acquire a strong back without getting hurt? Let’s start with large exercises like rack pulls. Rack Pulls Steve Goggins was famous for his back work. He was the first to squat 1100 with a body weight of 262. Chuck Vogelpohl has always done heavy rack work, and sometimes he worked up to 1100 or more on high pins. He holds the world record squat in the 275 bodyweight class at 1150 at an actual bodyweight of 264. I asked him why he did such heavy rack work. His answer was that it taught him how to strain. I thought if anyone knows how to strain, it’s Chuck. But then I realized it. Rack work taught him not only to strain but to think his way throughout the lift correctly. Most of his rack work was just below his knees to just above the knees. Mostly singles but sometimes 3 reps were done for added muscle tension. This is common for Russian and Ukrainian training. Chuck was so strong off the floor that he had to slow the start to hold onto the bar. His best meet deadlift was 835, and 900 in the gym with straps. I recommend that those of you who are not very strong at the floor do some pulls with the plates 2-4 and 6 inches off the floor. Good Mornings\nA second bar exercise for enormous back strength is good mornings. At Westside, we do several types of good mornings. I feel the arched lower back, rounded mid to upper back style is the best for the conventional deadlift. Reps for all except concentric good mornings should be 3-5 rep maxes. Good mornings can be done with straight legs, bent legs, rounded back, arched back, or any combination. Use a squat bar, Safety Squat bar, a 14-inch-cambered bar, or a Buffalo bar using a wide or close stance. At Westside, we do heavy good mornings lowering the plates into large foam blocks. Zercher Squat\nA third heavy bar exercise is the Zercher squat. Westside has developed a harness to do the lift with little stress on the arms. We do several versions of Zercher lifts off of the floor like Ed Zercher, the inventor, intended them to be done. Use whatever stance you like: wide, moderate, or close. Rack work is popular at Westside for the Zercher. Zercher squats off of a box can also be done. The reps will vary from 1 to 10. Walking with the Zercher harness loaded with up to 225 for a ¼ mile will blow up your lower back, hips, and hamstrings. Low Box Squat\nFor lower back and hip strength the very low box squat is great. If you have never squatted on a 10-inch or lower box, you are in for a treat. There are two versions of this. The close stance version will work the quads and lower back. Westside uses the front squat, Safety Squat bar, Buffalo bar, Zercher squat, and Manta Ray but never a regular squat bar. A squat bar is too hard on the bicep tendons. Also try very wide stance, low box squats with any bar mentioned in this article. You want to work up to a 3-5-rep max, but establish a 1-rep max as well. For weight gain, 5 reps work best. If you have to keep your weight down, do singles. Small Exercises for Lower Back\nFace away from the low pulley, grip a rope or short handles, walk forward a step or two, and squat down, letting your hands go between and behind your body, then pull your arms forward while keeping your arms straight and stand up. High reps (10-20) are used. Bent legs work the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back. The straight leg version will isolate the lower back more effectively. Dimel Deadlifts\nUse a shoulder-width stance, hands outside the legs with your back arched. After picking up the first rep, drop the bar first to the knees and return to lock out. Use a fast up and down tempo for 2 sets of 20 reps. Use a grip with the palms facing toward the body or use straps. Matt Dimel used this exercise to push an 820 squat that was stalled for a year to the 1010 world record that stood for years. His common weights were 225 to 275 for 2 sets of 20 reps four times a week. You want to do this for 2 weeks, then switch to a different special exercise. This exercise pushed Steve Wilson’s deadlift up from 815 to an official 865 at around 265 bodyweight. Ukrainian Deadlifts\nI was talking about training to my Ukrainian friends S. Naleykin and Konstantin Milyutin about special leg and lower back training. They said they do not do any special leg work, but they should. Konstantin told me while visiting Westside that they did 3 sets of 20 reps standing on two benches holding a 70 K, or 154 pound, kettlebell. After looking at the backs of their fellow lifters, I was intrigued. We started doing them and they blew us up. I tried sets of 20 reps in one workout with 53, 70, 88, 106, and 140 pounds and back to 70 pounds for a final set. This was too much volume, but I bought a 195-pound stone with a T-handle, and 3 sets of 20 reps worked very well. Stand on boxes or benches, round over, and perform the reps. The wider the feet, the more glute work; the closer the feet, the more lower back. Milyutin pulled 730 at 220, and Naleykin made 750 and almost 790 at 198. Remember, they use 154 pounds for the reps. We have several 800-pound deadlifters using 195 pounds. Sled Work\nSled pulling will raise not only your GPP but also your squat and deadlift. For strength we pull 200 feet at a time. A strap is placed over your power belt, not on the shoulders. Do not do less than six trips with very heavy weights: three 45-pound plates to six 45-pound plates. As the weight is held to one or two 45-pound plates, the trips can go up to 20 at times. This will greatly raise GPP but will do little for absolute strength. There is little stress on the spine with sled pulling. It will build the hips, glutes, hamstrings, quads, calves, and even the lower back. By rotating the hips in a very natural way even when doing upper body work with a second strap, the lower body is getting a workout. Try sled work for a boost in your squat and deadlift. Reverse Hypers\nI came up with this exercise in early 1974 after breaking my fifth lumbar vertebra. Nothing that I had previously done had helped the pain or range of motion, but this worked. I received my first United States patent in the 1990s. Now I own three U.S. patents, and Reverse Hyper is U.S. trademarked. This exercise is a decompression tool. It builds strength to stabilize the core of the muscular skeletal system. This also helps with the flexibility to perform dynamic motions. To make it simple, it makes you strong while rehabing the entire back, hamstrings, and glutes. Greg Panora pushed his squat from 920 to 1050 in 18 months. His deadlift has gone from 770 to 800. Luke Edward’s deadlift was 740 before coming to Westside, and in 5 months it went to 810. Greg and Luke are both 242-pound lifters. The Reverse Hyper is done at least four times a week, twice very heavy on squat day. This machine not only builds your lower back and complete posterior chain but provides decompression of the spinal column and aids in range of motion. There should be one in every gym, because it will not only build the lower back to the extreme but is the best prehab and restoration tool available on the market today. To become extremely strong, one must be healthy and fit; the exercises large and small discussed here will prolong your lifter career. The great Jon Cole once said the most important test a lifter has to pass is the test of time. Amen. Louie Simmons",

It’s that simple. But how do you acquire a strong back without getting hurt? Let’s start with large exercises like rack pulls. Rack Pulls Steve Goggins was famous for his back work. He was the first to squat 1100 with a body weight of 262. Chuck Vogelpohl has always done heavy rack work, and sometimes he worked up to 1100 or more on high pins. He holds the world record squat in the 275 bodyweight class at 1150 at an actual bodyweight of 264. I asked him why he did such heavy rack work. His answer was that it taught him how to strain. I thought if anyone knows how to strain, it’s Chuck. But then I realized it. Rack work taught him not only to strain but to think his way throughout the lift correctly. Most of his rack work was just below his knees to just above the knees. Mostly singles but sometimes 3 reps were done for added muscle tension. This is common for Russian and Ukrainian training. Chuck was so strong off the floor that he had to slow the start to hold onto the bar. His best meet deadlift was 835, and 900 in the gym with straps. I recommend that those of you who are not very strong at the floor do some pulls with the plates 2-4 and 6 inches off the floor. Good Mornings\nA second bar exercise for enormous back strength is good mornings. At Westside, we do several types of good mornings. I feel the arched lower back, rounded mid to upper back style is the best for the conventional deadlift. Reps for all except concentric good mornings should be 3-5 rep maxes. Good mornings can be done with straight legs, bent legs, rounded back, arched back, or any combination. Use a squat bar, Safety Squat bar, a 14-inch-cambered bar, or a Buffalo bar using a wide or close stance. At Westside, we do heavy good mornings lowering the plates into large foam blocks. Zercher Squat\nA third heavy bar exercise is the Zercher squat. Westside has developed a harness to do the lift with little stress on the arms. We do several versions of Zercher lifts off of the floor like Ed Zercher, the inventor, intended them to be done. Use whatever stance you like: wide, moderate, or close. Rack work is popular at Westside for the Zercher. Zercher squats off of a box can also be done. The reps will vary from 1 to 10. Walking with the Zercher harness loaded with up to 225 for a ¼ mile will blow up your lower back, hips, and hamstrings. Low Box Squat\nFor lower back and hip strength the very low box squat is great. If you have never squatted on a 10-inch or lower box, you are in for a treat. There are two versions of this. The close stance version will work the quads and lower back. Westside uses the front squat, Safety Squat bar, Buffalo bar, Zercher squat, and Manta Ray but never a regular squat bar. A squat bar is too hard on the bicep tendons. Also try very wide stance, low box squats with any bar mentioned in this article. You want to work up to a 3-5-rep max, but establish a 1-rep max as well. For weight gain, 5 reps work best. If you have to keep your weight down, do singles. Small Exercises for Lower Back\nFace away from the low pulley, grip a rope or short handles, walk forward a step or two, and squat down, letting your hands go between and behind your body, then pull your arms forward while keeping your arms straight and stand up. High reps (10-20) are used. Bent legs work the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back. The straight leg version will isolate the lower back more effectively. Dimel Deadlifts\nUse a shoulder-width stance, hands outside the legs with your back arched. After picking up the first rep, drop the bar first to the knees and return to lock out. Use a fast up and down tempo for 2 sets of 20 reps. Use a grip with the palms facing toward the body or use straps. Matt Dimel used this exercise to push an 820 squat that was stalled for a year to the 1010 world record that stood for years. His common weights were 225 to 275 for 2 sets of 20 reps four times a week. You want to do this for 2 weeks, then switch to a different special exercise. This exercise pushed Steve Wilson’s deadlift up from 815 to an official 865 at around 265 bodyweight. Ukrainian Deadlifts\nI was talking about training to my Ukrainian friends S. Naleykin and Konstantin Milyutin about special leg and lower back training. They said they do not do any special leg work, but they should. Konstantin told me while visiting Westside that they did 3 sets of 20 reps standing on two benches holding a 70 K, or 154 pound, kettlebell. After looking at the backs of their fellow lifters, I was intrigued. We started doing them and they blew us up. I tried sets of 20 reps in one workout with 53, 70, 88, 106, and 140 pounds and back to 70 pounds for a final set. This was too much volume, but I bought a 195-pound stone with a T-handle, and 3 sets of 20 reps worked very well. Stand on boxes or benches, round over, and perform the reps. The wider the feet, the more glute work; the closer the feet, the more lower back. Milyutin pulled 730 at 220, and Naleykin made 750 and almost 790 at 198. Remember, they use 154 pounds for the reps. We have several 800-pound deadlifters using 195 pounds. Sled Work\nSled pulling will raise not only your GPP but also your squat and deadlift. For strength we pull 200 feet at a time. A strap is placed over your power belt, not on the shoulders. Do not do less than six trips with very heavy weights: three 45-pound plates to six 45-pound plates. As the weight is held to one or two 45-pound plates, the trips can go up to 20 at times. This will greatly raise GPP but will do little for absolute strength. There is little stress on the spine with sled pulling. It will build the hips, glutes, hamstrings, quads, calves, and even the lower back. By rotating the hips in a very natural way even when doing upper body work with a second strap, the lower body is getting a workout. Try sled work for a boost in your squat and deadlift. Reverse Hypers\nI came up with this exercise in early 1974 after breaking my fifth lumbar vertebra. Nothing that I had previously done had helped the pain or range of motion, but this worked. I received my first United States patent in the 1990s. Now I own three U.S. patents, and Reverse Hyper is U.S. trademarked. This exercise is a decompression tool.

All ball teams keep stats, and they are invaluable to a team’s success. European weight lifting coaches kept many stats on how many lifts should be performed, what percent of 1-rep max is optimal, what constitutes speed strength and strength speed, what percentage to use for a circa-max cycle, how many box jumps to do per workout, and how to calculate volume. Let’s look at some very important stats for a powerlifter. Before going into some boring facts about powerlifting, I would like to acknowledge some former Soviet coaches that helped me formulate the method of training we use, commonly known as the Westside system. First, I would like to thank the late Prof. Mel C. Siff. I had many conversations with Mel, as well as co-speaking at seminars with him. He had great insight and knowledge about training. I first gained my training knowledge from Ohio’s greats, which are Anello, Crawford, and Pacifico. I picked up vast knowledge from Zatsirosky, Roman, Vorobyev, Ozolin, Matveyen, Kusnetsov, Komi, Kuntz, Berger, and Verkhoshansky, for his jumping and shock expertise, and last but not least, Jim Wendler, for saying that Westside is nothing special, it’s just the atmosphere. Jim, like many others, was handed a successful system that has been evolving long before he arrived at Westside, to develop a system of box squatting, board pressing, floor pressing, training by percents, band and chain training, circa-max phase, three-week pendulum waves, and now foam training. If Jim would have been at Westside in 1983 when I started implementing the research by A.S. Prilepin published in 1974, then learning about reactive methods, overspeed eccentrics, virtual force effect, and all of the methods mentioned above, he might realize beyond attitude there was aptitude. One will never learn to train until he is injured or stuck at a plateau. The first to say this was Vasily Alexeev, the greatest weight lifter of all time. Now about those stats, my first experience with true stats was A.S. Prilepin’s 1974 research mentioned in the book Managing the Training of Weight Lifters by Laputin and Oleshko, which showed that the following numbers of lifts are optimal. Percentage\nReps\nOptimal number of lifts 70%\n3-6\n18 80%\n2-4\n15 90%\n1-2\n7-10 Prilepin recommended the following number of lifts: 70%: no less than 12 and no more than 24 80%: no less than 10 and no more than 20 90%: no less than 4 and no more than 10 I suggest following the optimal number of lifts for a certain percentage. For those strong enough to do the circa-max phase use 7 or 8 lifts at 90-97% of a 1-rep max. A circa-max phase should last two weeks. Week 1: 2 or 3 sets of 2 reps plus 1 or 2 singles Week 2: 2 sets of 2 reps and 2 or 3 singles for a new box squat record Example: Matt, an OSU student, made his first official 800 squat drug-free. His 2-week circa-max phase looked like this: Week 1\nWeek 2 315×2\n315×2 365×2\n365×2 405×2\n415×1 465×1\n475×1 375 pounds of band tension\n510×1 This was off of a parallel box with contest gear, straps down, and no knee wraps. Relative Parameters\nFor an 800 contest squat: 500 bar weight plus 375 band weight 900 contest squat: 600 bar weight plus 375 band weight 1000 contest squat: 600 bar weight plus 440 band weight 1100 contest squat: 660 bar weight plus 500 band weight You must have good form and no obvious muscle weaknesses. You must be very strong but also very explosive. For speed strength, for a power or Olympic lifter and even a sportsman, do box squats with 40-45% bar weight plus band tension in the bottom of 10% and at the top, 20%. For example, Chuck Vogelpohl would do speed squats with 405-455 in a 3-week wave with one set of strong Jump-Stretch bands. They equal 100 pounds in the bottom and 200 pounds at the top. At that time, his squat was 1000 pounds. You do the math. A 500-pound squatter would do half the bar weight and half the band tension. Nine sets of 2 reps is optimal. For speed benching roughly 40% band tension at the top of the lift is used. For example, Fred Boldt has a contest best of 655 at 181 body weight. His floor press is 480 pounds, and his speed bench weight is 205 pounds, which equals roughly 40% bar weight and 40% band tension at the top. Because the bench speed strength weight is so light, 8 sets of 3 reps, the maximal number of lifts in the 70% range, is used. The system develops a fast rate of force development. The Maximal Effort Method\nThis method is exercising with maximal resistance with weight or a combination of weight and bands or chains. This means to lift a maximal weight with no time limit. This workout should occur 72 hours after speed work. I find it far superior to the method of heavy efforts, which means 2 or 3 reps with a slightly less than maximal effort. I want the highest intensity as possible, which means a max single depending on your level of preparedness. This method is superior for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. If you want to squat 1100, you must train for an 1100-pound squat. The muscles and the central nervous system adapt only to the load placed upon them (V. M. Zatsiorsky, The Science and Practice of Strength Training). When training weights exceed 90% for 3 weeks, the CNS will fail. Westside uses the conjugate sequence system. Every week we max out, but on a different bar exercise. This eliminates the stress on the CNS. We also use a 3-week pendulum wave. Westside had three men squat their first 804 by using a 3-week wave with 120 pounds of chains. Week 1: 405 x 8 sets of 2 reps Week 2: 440 x 8 sets of 2 reps\nWeek 3: 480 x 6 sets of 2 reps\nThis was around 1995. This work was done on Fridays; Monday was max effort day. For strength speed, the band tension should be as great as or greater than the bar weight. This system builds absolute strength. The bar may move very slowly, producing a very high rate of force production. Because the total weight is almost 100%, the number of lifts should be 6-8 singles. This is very hard work. Wear whatever gear you desire, no straps, no knee wraps. One cannot use just weight or just bands. When training with band tension, because of shrinkage, the tension can be too light in the bottom. This can cause momentum at the start, producing very little resistance at the start of the lift. Only bar weight can be too heavy at the start, leading to bar deceleration. Only a combination of bands and bar weight can solve the perpetual problem of having a perfect weight at the start and the finish without bar deceleration. This is accommodating resistance. Overspeed Eccentrics\nUsing bands to pull you downward at a faster rate than normal will produce a virtual force effect: a force that is there but not recognized. If you can triple velocity, you can produce nine times more kinetic energy. Of course, you can’t triple the eccentric phase, but by increasing it, the stretch reflex is greatly increased. A different reactive method is the lightened, or future, method, as the Soviets defined it: allowing one to lift a weight now that will be lifted in the near future. Interval Training Interval training was common in track, but not with weights. I realized its benefits for football teams at first. Interval training is doing a particular amount of work, with a predetermined amount of rest, for example, 8 to 12 sets of 2 reps, work time 4 to 8 seconds of work, with 40 seconds of rest between sets. Sounds like football to me. This works perfectly for power or Olympic lifting. It builds GPP plus with the correct percent builds a fast rate of force development. The multiple sets are associated with the dynamic effort. Maximal Effort Method: Application\nDoing a max single is much more effective than a set of 3 reps with 90% with weights. Light Efforts\nMedium Efforts\nHigh Efforts 70% weight\n80% weight\n90% weight When 2 reps can be completed for a few sets, this is circa-max, or nearmaximal, efforts. Only in special exercise is more than 1 rep preferred. At Westside, maximal effort is meant to mean the most weight lifted for 1 rep, hopefully a new personal record, but at least the most that can be lifted depending on your level of preparedness. This is the Bulgarian max effort system. I prefer a 1-rep max, hopefully exceeding an all-time max. This aids in reassuring your mental and emotional state, proving that you are stronger. Just like a contest. Try a weight around 90% and a weight just below or a small personal record then a third lift for a new personal record and a small second personal record. This is exactly like a power contest. My 25 years of data on max effort training shows more lifts of 90-100% plus lead to injury or overtraining. You have all read about maximal effort training in texts like Science and Practice of Strength Training, but remember, they are referring to Olympic lifting. The time under tension is much less than the power lifts. Also the power lifts are much heavier, leading to much higher training volume. If you want to increase your rate of force development, jump, bound, or try plyometrics. Our job as powerlifters is to lift as heavy a weight as possible. I would like to acknowledge the research of Rach (1956), Henry (1960), and Whitely. The role of strength becomes more important as the load increases. An increase in strength has no effect on speed of movement if the external resistance is small (M. Siff, Supertraining). This simply means you must train at a high percent of a 1-rep max most of the time. That is why approximately 50% of your volume must be between 75% and 85% of 1-rep max. A. D. Ermakov and N. S. Atanasov’s data in 1975 (Managing the Training of the Weight Lifter) showed that only about 19% of the barbell training was less than 70%. These relative loads should be higher because the power lifts are somewhat slower to complete. As far back as 1938 Hill’s equation was most widely used to explain this phenomenon. Also refer to Perrine and Edgerton’s 1978 research. The last 25 years of research at Westside, which has developed over 80 Elite lifters, has benefitted from the knowledge of Dr. G. Sanger, Dr. T. Paulucci, Dr. S. White, Dr. B. Whittaker, Dr. M. Liggett, Dr. Akita, a calculus professor, Dr. Joe Dellaquila, a physics professor, and Doug Ebert, a engineer from Virginia. Doug Heath and Matt Dimel were our first world record holders in the bench and squat, respectively. I thank Dave Tate, Chuck Vogelpohl, George Halbert, and many more for constructing our current system. I also thank my good tattooed friend Jim Wendler, who pointed out the fact that Westside does have a special attitude, and also a special aptitude for training.\nLouie Simmons",

What if we were born with the wisdom and the reasoning of a 65-year-old? We would make more right decisions and possibly stay out of trouble and make the most of our time while weíre young. Then as we get older, we could start thrill-chasing and taking chances that instinctively we would never consider. This of course would lead us to live by the code of the poet Dylan Thomas, ì Do not go gentle into that good night, old age should burn and rage at close of day; rage, rage against the dying of the lightî (1940). I try to live as Dylan Thomas put into words, and yes, I have the scars to prove it. But of course we can never live our lives in reverse. There are a few that have read the exploits of a person who has been said to have made great progress doing letís say eccentrics. But were there other factors involved in their training? I have read several articles by sports experts around the globe, yet none have conclusive evidence that eccentrics work. Mel Siff in Supertraining explains eccentrics as action in which the proximal and distal muscle attachments move away from one another. Eccentric work uses significantly less energy than concentric work. When doing slow eccentrics with large loads, there is no reason to associate these advantages with the possibility of developing the ability to move quickly and powerfully in concentric work. Lowering weights slowly builds larger muscles for body building but will not assist concentric actions. Let’s look at depth jumps. One is accelerating close to 9.8 meters/second/second when one lands on the floor. Everyone knows they work, so why would you lower a weight at 0.1 or 0.2 meters/second and destroy the stretch reflex? In the book Science of Sports Training, T. Kurz states that some athletes can lower 10% to 60% more than they can overcome concentrically.\nAll this said, slow eccentrics have no place in powerlifting. To build larger muscles, yes. If you want to become very sore, yes. What does it matter if you can lower 60% more than you can raise? If I recall correctly, you must raise the bar from the floor in a clean, snatch, and deadlift. In the bench press after the bar is lowered to the chest, after the pause, you must raise the bar to completion. The squat is similar. After lowering to parallel, you must, for a fraction of a second, hold the weight statically and then raise to completion. If you load the bar with 60% more than your best squat of, say, 1000 pounds, the total bar weight would be 1600 pounds. Does this sound like a good idea to you? A weight that feels fine at the top becomes much too heavy in the bottom. How can a bar weight be perfect at the top and also at the bottom? It canít. Thatís precisely why we use a combination of bar weight and bands or chains to accommodate resistance, causing a reactive method. But thatís another story. The key to eccentric success is overspeed eccentrics. Hopefully, you already know that force equals mass times acceleration. But the force is almost always connected to concentric movements. What about eccentric work? Light weights can be lowered with greater acceleration than heavy weights, just as in concentric movements. You must understand that the largest force may not always be associated with the heaviest loads. Jump-Stretch bands can produce much greater acceleration properties by pulling the bar down by means of great tension. This causes overspeed eccentrics, adding to kinetic energy. If one could triple the bar speed on the eccentric phase, it would produce 9 times the kinetic energy. In a simple action, such as a depth jump, a 200-pound man jumping off a platform of 10 feet will produce many times his body weight. Force will decrease on concentric movements due to deceleration, while force will increase on eccentric movements due to acceleration. This leads us to a problem that many never consider: optimal eccentrics. How much muscle tension should one use on eccentric movements? If it is true that an individual can lower 60% more than they can raise, then applying 100% of his eccentric strength, he could hold the bar at any position. However, he would destroy the stretch reflex with heavy weights. Overcoming inertia is done with light weights with a fast eccentric stop to build reversal strength. This is ballistic training. The bar never touches the chest. One to three inches off the chest is recommended. If you drop a 10-pound rock and a 1-pound rock from the same distance, they hit the ground at the same time. But as one lowers a heavy weight, as the weight increases, the eccentric phase slows down. This is due to too much eccentric muscle action. There are optimal bar speeds for velocity training, where the objective is fast movements with light loads, and for force training, where the bar speed may be zero or very low, to produce maximum force. There are optimal bar speeds for these efforts, and they are always measured in concentric movements. So should there not be an optimal eccentric speed? Of course, it is just that no one has ever considered it. Until now. How can you learn to optimally lower heavy loads in the pressing and squatting or good morning exercises? You can use a foam block for assisted eccentrics training. In my experiments with a Tendo unit, comparing the eccentric and concentric bar speed with speed strength benching and squatting, the difference was one-tenth of a meter per second. The same was true for a circa-max phase in the squat. A combination of band tension and weight was used. The bands cause an accommodating resistance effect on the concentric phase and an overspeed eccentric effect on the eccentric phase, increasing kinetic energy in the stretch reflex. The eccentric/concentric phase on speed strength should be 0.7 to 0.8 meters/second. On near-max weights, this should be 0.5 meters/second. Remember, this was done with adding bands to the bar. But how do you lower just weight in a fast manner? This is done by using roughly 60% of your eccentric potential. I have done ballistic benching with 200 pounds when my raw bench was 500. As you can see, I am dropping almost 40% of my best raw bench. I was lowering the bar at around 0.5 meters/second. Watching Elite benchers at Westside perform at similar eccentric speed, I noticed that this has led to a faster concentric phase. How did we learn to lower heavier loads in the bench and squat? We use foam blocks to bench off of, lowering the plates onto the foam. We sit on the foam for box squatting. Here are some of the methods we use. For floor pressing, lie on a 7-inch foam pad. Your entire torso will sink into the foam, which causes an unstable effect. Floor presses can be done while lying on the floor and adding small, 18 x 18 inch, foam pads under the arms only. This will enable the arms to relax concentrically more than normal. The king of all optimal eccentrics for benching is to lower the bar so that the plates are lowered into the foam blocks. One can almost totally relax eccentrically. This contributes to a fast rate of reversal strength, adding to a powerful concentric phase. This will undoubtedly help not only raw benching but also lowering weights in bench shirts. For deadlifting, we stand on foam pads while doing pulls. It will immediately build leg drive, in conventional or sumo style. For box squatting, we sit on a 24 x 28 inch foam block. It feels like a half box squat and half regular squat. We also stand on a foam pad while box squatting to get extra leg drive and for superior glute and hip development and lower back strength and flexibility. A standard box squatting method is to place a 7 x 24 inch pad on a hard box. We have used these methods for 3 years. They work. They are also great for rehabilitation of knees and ankles, by walking in place without shoes. Proof positive is a high school senior jumping onto a 57-inch box. These methods work for explosive work as well as max effort work. If youíre smart, it will be prehab if you start now. Optimal eccentrics, a muscular and reflex phase of strength training, can bring about superior gains, just as Verkhoshansky found shock training produced after watching triple jumpers perform. A new idea, a new training method can revolutionize strength. So donít quit; rather, donít go gently into that good night. ìOld age should burn and rage at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.”\nLouie Simmons",

Everyone has their viewpoint. The United States, for the most part, will start young, 8-10 years old, in a particular sport such as football, baseball, basketball, boxing, and wrestling. It’s almost always sports specific. That is, they participate in the sport with no prior general physical preparedness (GPP). In the old Soviet countries, there were sport institutes that prepared the youth age 12 and above for sports but not by playing a certain sport, but by a well-prepared process of GPP. This is general mobility, flexibility, dexterity, endurance, hand/eye coordination, balance, and strength. For example, pushups, pull-ups, rope climbing, medicine ball work, kettle bell work, and some running and short sprints are done. They produced the model athlete for their sports system. Children were chosen for the sport that suited their physical, mental, and emotional qualities. Neither the child nor the parents were able to pick the sport.\nHere in the United States, football is huge. Go to any park and a million kids are playing football. Of course, only a small percentage will go on to play college ball, and even fewer will go on to the NFL. But all that sprinting, jumping, and agility drills formed the GPP for power lifting. Kenny Patterson started lifting at Westside at 14 years old and became the youngest to bench press over 700 pounds and hold an open world record at 22 years old with a 728 bench at 275 body weight. Mike Brown benched 735 at 19 years old, still the biggest bench by a teen. Mike has gone on to total over 2500. Dave “Neutron” Hoff, at 16, squatted 805, benched 515, and deadllifted 650 at 220. Now at 19 years old Neutron has made a 1005 squat, a 680 bench, and a 745 deadlift, to total 2430. This is the largest and only 1000-pound squat by a teen and the biggest total by any teen at any weight. How did Kenny Patterson, Mike Brown, and now Neutron make the lifts they did? When they came to Westside, each was placed in a group of advanced lifters. Instead of one coaching many, many coached one. Bob Coe and Gritter Adams oversaw everything Neutron did. He was surrounded by top 10 lifters to help in his development. He could easily handle the physical work, but more important to me was the fact he could cope with the mental process of learning the methods and with the never-ending expectations placed on him. Like those that preceded him, Neutron has the most advanced methods at his disposal. Like Mike Brown, Neutron uses a lot of foam box squatting, lowering his regular box and placing a 7-inch foam pad on top. This makes box squatting very taxing on the muscles. It feels like there is no bottom in the squat. This causes better balance and feels somewhere between a regular squat and a box squat. On max effort day he does rack pulls with and without bands, good mornings with a variety of bars, Zercher squats, fronts squats, or Manta Ray squats. When he feels fatigued, he will do only hypers, glute/ham raises, lat work, sled work, and abs. There are many exercises to choose from on max effort day. He will do 3 or 4 exercises and rotate them according to his needs. By switching exercises frequently, the central nervous system is never fatigued. The max effort exercises are rotated weekly. The special exercises are rotated whenever progress slows or boredom sets in.\nNeutron does very little special exercises after the main workout. He is biomechanically suited to squat, bench, and deadlift; thus his training is geared toward that fact. Pavel would say that Neutron is a model athlete.\nOn speed squat day bands and chains are used 95% of the time. Occasionally he will use free weights while squatting on foam. He will stand on foam and sit on foam about 25% of the time. About 60% of the workouts are done sitting on foam only, but always sitting on some kind of a box. He will warm up in gym shorts, then groove briefs, and will use what gear it takes on very heavy work days.\nHis bench workout looks the same, but he never uses a bench shirt on speed day. Nine sets of 3 reps with three different grips are used. Mini-bands, monster mini-bands, or 2 or 3 sets of 5/8 inch chains are used to accommodate resistance in many combinations. Triceps extensions with dumbbells or barbells are done every workout and with as high volume and high intensity as possible. The lats are second on his list. He then does pulldowns, rows with barbells or dumbbells, chest-supported rows, upper back, rear and side delts, and some hamstrings and curls to end the workout.\nOn max effort bench day the workout changes each week. The following can be done: floor press with just bar weight, with chains, or bands, regular bench with chains or bands, incline or decline press, weight releasers, ultrawide-grip or close- grip bench, and dumbbell press at different angles. This is the conjugate system. Changing the rate of bar speed on dynamic day, changing the amount of bands or chains on the bar, or adding a hanging kettle bell to the bar causes a chaotic state. The lightened method with overhead bands of different strength can also be done.\nScience tells us that doing the same exercise for 3 weeks with a weight of 90% or greater will cause progress to stop. By switching the main core exercise each week, you can continue to make progress indefinitely. How? By not negatively affecting the CNS. This holds true for speed day as well. By switching the accommodating resistance, one can avoid the speed barrier. This is when one feels he cannot move the bar any faster regardless of how hard they try.\nAs you can see, we train a teen like an advanced lifter, just by training by percent’s and picking the correct special exercises to complement his weaknesses. Only time will tell how far he can go, but so far there’s no stopping Neutron.\nLouie Simmons",

What are the velocities of explosive strength and isometric strength? The answer is high velocity and zero velocity. But what does this have to do with you? Will one help develop mostly speed and the other strength? Isometric work will increase strength where speed is less important. Explosive strength is essential when high velocity is required against small loads. Remember, the amount of speed obtained is a direct reflection of external resistance.\nLet’s look at how to build special strengths and to understand how important a role they play in the development of a world class powerlifter. Through much study of world class weight lifters, the average weight lifted by percent and total volume goes up as mastery of the sport increases. This rule holds true for throwers and sprinters as well. I’m probably the only person to collect data on world class powerlifters, so some may think my findings inconclusive because there’s no other data to compare to. However, they are along the same lines as the Soviet Olympic lifters.\nOne must possess all special strengths to succeed. Explosive strength is also referred to as explosive power and is the ability to rapidly increase force (Tidow, 1990). It is best developed through jumping, bounding, and other forms of plyometrics, not Olympic lifts. To be the fastest would require no resistance.\nFor jumping, one must use a rotational system: vertical jumping, jumping from the knees, jumping from the knees with weight on your back, power snatch on the knees, power snatch while seated, power snatch into a split stance.\nWe have had enormous success with football 40-yard times from jumping with dumbbells of different weights and onto different box heights, jumping with ankle weights up to 20 pounds on each leg, a combination of jumping with dumbbells and ankle weights, and jumping onto a box while standing on a foam pad. It is to be noted that many don’t know how to jump or land. Here we do a series of jumps up to a box and down and up to a second, and possibly a third. Jumping is not as simple as it looks. For general explosive strength, jump down and onto an even higher box. For the development of concentric strength, we jump down from a low box to a much higher box. Eccentric development is best gained by jumping down from a high box and rebounding up to a low box. The optimal box height depends on general fitness. Jumping with resistance does not disturb jumping form, but running with resistance will. You need to know these basic concepts. Much information can be found on this subject in the book Explosive Power and Jumping Ability for all Sports (Starzynski and Sozanski).\nSpeed strength is the ability to exert maximal force during high-speed movement (Allerheiligen, 1994). It is most common to train athletes of all types with small weight resistance to build speed strength. This is a very sensible method to increase speed, sometimes referred to as the dynamic method. This is quite common for football players. By using light weights of the same resistance over and over, one can develop a phenomenon known as the speed barrier. I watch runners run at the same pace; then eventually they cannot run faster. This is true for football players as well. If a player trains with only light weights, he will not become any stronger or faster. The problem of a speed barrier occurs most likely with novices who start sport-specific training too early without extensive GPP. You have all seen it: Ball players that only play their brand of baseball, football, or basketball (Naglak, 1977).\nThe answer is to raise absolute strength. Increasing maximal strength improves speed of movement with heavy weight and will have a positive effect on small loads or even body weight. Let’s say lifter A can squat a max of 300 pounds and trains at 60%, or 180 pounds, for speed strength for multiple sets, and lifter B can squat 600 pounds for a max. Now let’s say lifter B uses lifter A’s 60% (180 pounds). Can you imagine how fast he would move the same 180 pounds? This points out the importance of raising your limit strength to improve speed strength.\nHow can the speed barrier be broken? On speed strength day, we use a 3-week wave with bar weight ranging from 40% to 60% of a 1-rep max. To vary the accommodating resistance, we use one, two, or three sets of 5/8-inch chain hanging from the bar. (The Westside Barbell DVDs will show you how to use chains correctly.) After a 3-week wave, switch to weight releasers. Increase or decrease the weight during the 3 weeks. We also use a wide variety of band tensions. We also hang kettle bells from the bar using a doubled-up mini-band. Use your imagination. There are many ways to break the speed barrier. For more information, see Science of Sports Training (Kurz).\nStrength speed is sometimes referred to as slow strength. When lifting near-maximal loads over 90%, the barbell will move slowly due to minimal acceleration. As Dr. Hatfield said, no one can lift a heavy weight slow. Instead one tries to complete the lift as fast as possible. The top weight lifters overseas use weights from 75% to 85% 51% of the time.\nAll strength types are connected. When one is properly trained using the three methods—dynamic, repetition, and maximal effort—each method will contribute to the other two. Of course, a barrier exists with heavy weights as well. We have all been stuck at some weight in some lift. We know that one must train as heavy and often as possible. If one trains with a weight of 90% or more for more than 3 weeks, one will fail, thus causing a slow speed barrier. What’s the answer? At Westside we use the conjugate system. Each week we max out, but we switch the core exercise each week. For example, for squat or deadlift training, on week 1 do a low box squat with the Buffalo bar; week 2, rack pulls; week 3, lightened band deadlifts; week 4, Safety squat bar on a foam box while standing on foam. On bench max effort day, on week 1 do 3-board press; week 2, cambered bar with 5 sets of chains; week 3, floor press; week 4, steep incline press. These are just examples, and of course, the small exercises or special exercises will change as well, but not as often. By constantly changing the core lift each week, one can max out throughout the year without burning out. This system allows you to work on your weaknesses. This is a tremendous advantage over other systems, plus it perfects your form.\nAnother special strength is isometrics. Bob Peoples experimented with isometrics years ago. He found them very taxing yet very productive. He would sometimes hold the weight for 40 seconds. Bob found it hard on the circulation. A second method was to select a position and barely move the weight off the pins. Set a goal of 5 reps and work up to 10 reps; then add weight. For both systems he would use very heavy weight. We use more moderate weight for many sets.\nIsometrics will build strength 15 degrees in each direction, above and below the bar position. The Eastern Bloc training system found that it was just as effective to pull on a static bar for time as it was to pull very hard for 3-6 seconds. Select three or four positions to work from in each workout. In isometric action the muscle tension changes while the length of the muscle remains constant. The effort for the most part should be increased gradually until the desired intensity is achieved. Of course, it is hard to gauge the amount of effort being displayed. You can approximate the effort more closely by lifting a predetermined weight off one pin up to a second pin. Hold for the time desired. Always do isometric work at the end of the workout.\nIt is your job as a coach or a self-taught weight enthusiast to learn where and when to use the strength methods described above.\nLouie Simmons",

First, you must possess all the strength qualities such as speed strength, strength speed, and a high work capacity with high‐intensity workouts. This means close to or above 100%. If you cannot train almost constantly heavy year in and year out, you will never reach your full potential.\nThere have been a lot of has‐beens. They were superstars for a short time and then disappeared as fast as they came. There are many factors that contribute to these short careers. Some lifters can’t cope mentally, while others fail physically. Some complain about today’s gear, but its here to stay. Here’s the problem with many lifters: they cannot believe in their hearts that they can lift the weights many lifters are doing today. The old guys cry foul, but in fact they used every advantage that was available to them in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\nWhat about training, and how do some stand the test of time while others fall off the mountain as fast as they went up? Three lifters that have maintained a very high level of performance are Amy Weisberger, Chuck Vogelpohl, and George Halbert.\nAmy has been the all‐time total record holder in the 123s and currently holds not only the 132 total record at 1333 (over 10 times body weight) but also the 148 total at 1440 with a world record 590 squat, 350 bench press, and 500 deadlift, all this at 42 years old.\nChuck won the 1987 YMCA Nationals with a 1968 total at 220. In the early 2000s, he broke the squat record with a 1025 plus a 2319 total at 220. In April 2007, he squatted 1150 and totaled 2605 at 264. In August 2007, he pulled an 835 deadlift, his all‐time best at 42 years old.\nGeorge has broken 11 all‐time world records in the bench press in three weight classes: 198, 220, and 242.All three of these lifters can maintain a high intensity and high volume of training. All three have developed the ability to train when they are very muscularly sore. Both Amy and Chuck use the same format. They squat on Fridays with mostly bands and chains. Because Amy is 5’ 2’’, she places the bands over the plates. Her training sets with at least 180 pounds of band tension range from 275 for 8 sets to 365 for 4 sets. Her best box squat with bands is 440. This netted her a world record 590 at 147 pounds body weight.\nThe introduction of large amounts of bands added to the squat weights changed everything. While gaining weight is not conducive to raising the deadlift, Amy pulled two personal records, 485 and 500, to total 1440 at 147 pounds. Amy’s two styles of deadlifting both employ bands. She pulls off the floor for speed strength with mini‐bands that provide 100 pounds of tension on the floor and 220 at lock‐ out. She does 4‐8 singles after she squats. Amy also does rack pulls with a monster mini‐band or a light band. The tension may be up to 300 pounds plus bar weight.\nAmy’s squat and deadlift training is a high‐volume, high‐intensity program. Regardless of her trainability, she goes as hard as possible. She increases her GPP by mainly concentrating on sled pulling for upper and lower body. She works on flexibility, mobility, and muscular endurance and pays close attention to her weaknesses.\nAmy trains the bench in the same manner: chains and bands are used 95% of the time. She also uses special kettlebells, by themselves or attached to the bar with mini‐bands.\nAmy has competed with the best during the 1980s and 1990s and currently, and she remains the brightness in the night sky referred to as a star.\nChuck Vogelpohl is half man, half amazing. He won his first Nationals in 1987 and the WPO in two divisions, setting world records in two weight classes and squatting more in the 275’s than the 308 world record. How does he do it, and is he looking for more?First let’s look at his squat training. He had trouble in the early stages of squatting, not in the bottom, but at the very top, but after experimenting with bands, it solved his problem of extreme bar deceleration.\nFor speed strength training, his band weight combination is 40% bar weight and 10% band tension on the box. An additional 25% band tension is at the top of the squat. He does this type of training to build a fast rate of force development.\nFor absolute strength development, the band tension will be near the bar weight. His best box squat with 640 pounds of band tension is 835, which equals 1475 at the top and 1085 at the bottom on a parallel box. Chuck says that lots of heavy bands has pushed his squat up to the 1150 he has done recently.\nChuck likes to do very heavy rack pulls, sometimes up to more than 1100 pounds, a few inches above the knees. This teaches him to strain, and if anybody knows how to strain, it’s Chuck.\nHis system is just like Amy’s: high volume, high intensity, always trying to do more sets and more weight per set. His training is very dense, meaning short rests between sets per training period. He fully intends to squat over 1200 in the 275’s.\nHis bench press is trained just like everyone else’s at Westside. It has suffered somewhat from two triceps surgeries and a broken neck from playing in the gym with the late Matt Dimel. He has the best training partners, training system, and training environment, and he is a very large part of that.\nAmy and Chuck use the same training system. Our max effort work is modeled after the Bulgarians’. There is a difference though; they limited their exercises to six or so after mastering form. While we max out almost every Monday and Wednesday for the squat, bench, and deadlift, we use special exercises, but seldom the actual squat, bench, or deadlift. This might consist of box or rack pulls with bands over the bar or the lightened method. Pavel refers to the second method as the future method, meaning doing a weight now that one will do in the future. Another option is box squats on a variety of box heights and with various bars. The bench workouts consist of the conjugate system, e.g., floor press with weight only, bands, or chains; board press; or incline, decline, closegrip, or wide grip bench. It is your job to find what exercises make you strong and which one shows how strong you are.\nGeorge Halbert started out doing full power meets and was very strong in all three lifts. However, he found the bench was to become his destiny. He now has world records in three weight classes, for a total of 12.\nGeorge has a speed day and a max effort day like everyone else. On speed day, he does singles with a lot of bands and with different band tensions. The lifts are an optimal 12‐18 per workout. He does a lot of experimentation with multiple mini‐ bands while leaving the bar weight the same. George has found overspeed eccentrics to be very valuable for speed work as well as max effort work.\nUnlike the full powerlifters, George only benches on the two main days; no other work is done on these days. However, he trains the bench five times a week. He has a max effort upper back day twice a week where he does lots of rows. He also has a hypertrophy day. Yes, it’s a lot like body building, including curls to balance out the arms. He also does a lot of hammer curls, delt work, upper back work, and a small amount of chest work.\nEveryone at Westside, including George, has a max effort day and a dynamic day and does a lot of repetition work to near failure. This program is constructed with the conjugate system in mind and constantly pushes GPP. If you want to be a star and last many decades, I suggest you try the Westside methods.\nLouie Simmons",

If you don’t have a big squat, you ain’t squat. At Westside, we have three lifters who squat more than 1100 pounds and 12 who squat more than 1000.\nEveryone knows that we box squat. It’s the best and safest way to squat. If one wants to box jump higher, sit on a box and jump onto a second box, and you will achieve the highest jumps possible after eliminating the first box at a later date.\nMany have opinions on which is the best method to squat, the Olympic style squat versus the power squat. I know this: the top Olympic lifters are normally 20 to 24 years old. The top powerlifters are around 40 years old. Chuck Vogelpohl has squatted 1150 at a body weight of 264 at over 40 years old. Amy Weisberger is 41 and just squatted 590 at 147 body weight. Chuck totaled over 2600, and Amy 1440. So give me the power squat.\nYou will gain body weight with the power squat, and a wide squat will build more muscle where it counts. But what about the other methods of squatting?\nBelt squatting is not only a proven method of developing a strong lower body but also very therapeutic for the spine because the belt is positioned around the waist. Belt squats will traction the spine and correct pelvic tilt. When your back is taxed too much, you can work the legs. They are great for static work or teaching one to jump.\nThe front squat is essential for leg strength and maintaining a correct back position for pulling. This was Eddy Copplin’s favorite exercise for deadlifting, having pulled 826 at 186 body weight. It builds the spinal erectors as well as the legs. (We use a front squat harness.)\nThe Manta Ray device forces one to do a super-Olympic-style squat. The Manta Ray will cause the bar placement to be 2 or 3 inches above the top of the shoulder, causing the lifter to stay very upright. Isuggest that Olympic lifters implement this into their training as well as the belt squat.\nThe rackable cambered bar is great to save the shoulders of large or simply tight lifters. Holding the hands 10 to 12 inches lower than normal lessens the stress on the pecs and delts. This will save a bench career. The Buffalo bar has roughly a 2-inch camber, but that is enough for some lifters to relieve stress on the upper body. A cambered bar will shift the weight somewhat forward while squatting. We also use the cambered bars with the front squat harness. The more combinations you use, the better you will squat.\nWe use many forms of reactive and contrast methods, meaning chains, bands, weight releasers, and the lightened method, or as Pavel Tsatsouline refers to it as the future method, i.e., lifting a weight now by lightening the bottom portion that is lifted in the future.\nWestside has also found success by box squatting off a dense foam pad or by standing on foam pads, or both.\nAre there other forms of squatting done at Westside? Yes. The Zercher squat. Ed Zercher invented this exercise years ago. I was first intrigued after reading about Robert Barnett doing the Zercher lift, where one squatted down and hooked the elbows under the bar and stood up. Mr. Barnett was capable of doing 5 reps off the floor with 395. His body weight was 165 and he could deadlift 675. He did this around 1966. After getting out of the army in 1969, I started doing Zercher squats off the floor. My best was 320, and I made a 670 deadlift in 1973 at 181. When I moved up to 198, I couldn’t lift the bar off the floor because I had become too thick around the waist. I started doing a Zercher squat. I would lift the bar, which was on a low rack pin, in my elbows and go as low as possible. I used two versions: One was to lower the bar until it sat on my knees. The second was to lower the bar out over my knees as low as possible, then drop my hips as low as I could to stretch the lower back and then stand up. With this method, I made 500 at an all-star wrestling convention. At the time I made an official 710 deadlift at 198. This was around 1978. I tore my right bicep almost completely off at the1979 USPF Senior Nationals. After that, I could no longer hold the bar in my elbows with heavy weights.\nI don’t know what took so long, but I finally made a Zercher harness that allows one to use huge weights and to lift the bar off the floor. Amy Weisberger’s best deadlift was 468 after a 21-year career at Westside, but after a 4-month cycle of adding the Zerchers, after squatting a 590 world record she then pulled a 485 personal record and then a 500 deadlift, all this at 41 years old. The only alteration to her training was the addition of the Zercher lifts off the floor, out of the rack, and in a bent-over good morning version.\nChuck Vogelpohl also made an 835 deadlift for an all-time personal record, then tried 875 but missed it at the knees. This Zercher harness is unreal. If you want to try it, look for it on the Westside Barbell web site.\nLouie Simmons",

It can be many things to many people. The optimal number of lifts is first and foremost at Westside Barbell. There is an optimal number of reps and sets, length of rest time between sets, and length of time between extreme workouts. There is also an optimal number of sets and reps with bands, chains, weight releasers, and just barbell weight. It is important to know what is optimal for you with the contrast effect, such as bands, chains, and weight releasers.\nThe lifts can be more effective with chains to accommodate resistance. The lifts become more taxing; thus a slight reduction is made in the total set count. When using weight releasers, only one lift out of two reps is effective because of the eccentric overload on the first rep of each set. The use of bands when applied correctly provides great tension throughout the entire range of motion.\nPrilepin’s 1974 research was based on numerous world, European, and Olympic competitors. He calculated minimal, maximal, and of course optimal numbers of sets and reps at certain intensity zones. His work provided us with the maximum number of reps after which the lifts would slow down and thus become less effective. He determined what load was sufficient to make progress and what load was too taxing and would reduce the training effect. His work was based on Olympic lifts, which are lighter and of course faster, utilizing less muscle tension than the powerlifts.\nMy work is valid, having 75 Elite lifters and nine men who total over 2500 and two over 2600 to date. Our findings are similar to Prilepin’s if you calculate time under tension. Most of our box squat percentages are between 75% and 85%, for example. Of the top Olympic lifters (I am talking about the lifters overseas), 50% of their training of the lifts is between 75% and 85%. (See Managing the Training of Weight Lifters, Laputin andOleshko.) The Westside Barbell web site has training information on squat, bench, and deadlift loading as it relates to volume and intensity.\nWhen training optimally, we observed that it is the special exercises that must be given careful consideration. I watch everything that goes on as far as training at Westside. Some of our lifters do an amazing amount of upper body training, and it shows as far as physical development is concerned, but does little to aid in their bench progress. Others do very little extra lat, triceps, or delt work, yet have a superior bench press. It should be noted that we have in house 23 700‐pound benchers. This is also true for our squatters and deadlifters. We have 11 lifters who squat over 1000 and three over 1141. Fourteen deadlift over 800. Nine total more than 2500 and two more than 2600. As you can see, this is a highly skilled group.\nHow can the special exercise volume vary so much from lifter to lifter? Biomechanics is one reason. Some men and women are more suited to squat, bench, or deadlift than others. They obviously need less work for the primary movers such as the low back, hips, and glutes. Triceps, lats, and delts, even ab work, can vary a great deal.\nWhat about psychological types. The introvert doesn’t need as much stimulation as others in training. He appears to be more methodical when lifting maximal weights and is not as explosive. The extrovert is very explosive. Tyrel Owens comes to mind, and Ray Lewis in football and Chuck Vogelpohl in powerlifting. Not only are they very strong, but they possess a very highly active central nervous system. The two groups seldom function well together on the same program.\nMany lifters seem to overanalyze training, form, rest, and nutrition. It has been my experience that these men fail to reach the very top and spend a lot of time wondering why. Plan well, train hard, and have passion to reach your goals. Your training must suit your physical, psychological, and mental needs. It can’t be a cookie‐cutter program.\nLouie Simmons",

He was a powerlifting pioneer. His 725 deadlift at 185 in the 1940s and 1950s is legendary. Bob did heavy rack work from different heights for squatting as well as deadlifting. He would also use a special device that would lift a heavy weight up to lockout. It would lower itself, and Bob would do eccentric work without the help of spotters.\nBob was very innovative when it came to lifting. His most famous lifter was Paul Anderson. He made lifts that even today would stagger the mind: 1160 in the 1950s. Paul also did a lot of partials for his squatting ability. He made squat racks that were welded to the bar. When he got under the bar, the squat racks were lifted as well. Paul did a lot of concentric work. This means that he would crawl under the bar and lift it without first lowering it eccentrically.\nPaul would attach strong chains so a bar would rest in the chains at different heights off the floor, and a squat, bench, deadlift, or standing press was performed. We use the same system at Westside. They are referred to as suspended chain squats or good mornings. I have seen several Olympic lifters from East European countries do squats, pulls, and good mornings off power rack pins. I wonder if our Olympic lifters do this type of work.\nA man that used a power rack to build amazing bulk and mass was Anthony Ditillo. His training was documented in Perry Rader’s old and original Iron Man magazine. He would place the bar on a set pin and from a dead start press the weight over, lower it back to the pin, and after a second or two do a second rep. He, like many, worked out at the local YMCA, the Elizabeth, NJ, YMCA. He would also work at his father’s pool hall and candy shop. Maybe that’s where he gained his unbelievable mass. No, it was the rack work.\nReading about Ditillo and his training partner Dezzie Ban, I also did a lot of rack work. I have always said that first you need a training partner, and second, a power rack. Ditillo was outrageous at 5 foot 5 inches and 330 pounds at this best. A lot of his partial movements were done with an isometric hold for 1 or 2 seconds. He would then lower the bar to the pin and rest a second, and a second partial rep was done again with an isometric hold. His system built a great amount of starting strength at different angles, and also isometric strength at the top of each rep where motion was no longer possible.\nAnthony Jr. has told me his father’s best was 455 for 3 reps seated and 500 for 3 reps standing and 600 for 1 rep close grip to the forehead.\nThrough the years after studying these men and the weightlifters from the former Soviet Union and their variations of rack training, I have combined the old ways with the new. By using a power rack to start at any level I wanted to, I found I was able to complete almost any weight I could separate from the pin. Many modern lifters do heavy rack work and swear it works for them. I asked Chuck Vogelpohl why he does monstrous weights in the rack, sometimes up to 1100. He said it teaches him how to strain. But like many, he will never do a regular deadlift like the 1000+ rack pulls he does on a regular basis. I have observed a lot of rack pulls from all pin positions and have found that the posture of the lifter is always different from the way he would be pulling off the ground to that same height as the pin. The human body will always find the most advantageous way to do physical work. This is referred to as the kinesiological pattern, or simple biomechanics. The strongest muscle groups, the legs and back, have a big role in effective biomechanics. The body will naturally seek the most advantageous leverage to lift the most weight. This is the reason a lifter can lift 800 pounds to the knees and fail, but if the bar is lifted off a pin at the same level he can easily lift the same 800 pounds. This is simply the body’s ability to effectively master motor skills. Unfortunately, when you lift the barbell off the floor, your posture is quite different. One reason is the distance the bar has to travel to reach a sticking point. Another reason is bar speed. These two factors almost always cause a miss.\nWhatever your style is, when lifting the bar off the floor, at the knee or lockout, every lift must be the same. But how? How can you lift overloads, like a power rack allows, but with the same form? The answer is band pulls off the floor.\nWe do our deadlifts three ways. One way is off the floor with bands over the bar. For speed work, a doubled‐up mini‐band over the bar is used. At the floor it provides 100 pounds of resistance, and at lockout, 220 pounds. A lifter at Westside made 475 plus mini‐bands for a gym record and at a meet did 675. I made 535 plus mini‐bands and made 715 at the meet. Matt Wenning has done 545 with a sumo style and 770 conventional at the meet. Matt gets a great carryover. One reason is that he is not very good at sumo style deadlifting, but it works all his weaknesses. He pulls conventionally at meets.\nTo work heavy weights at the knee or lockout, place a second band over the bar to accommodate a large amount of resistance at the knee or higher. A pair of light bands over the bar will add 100 pounds more at the top, a medium band 150 pounds, and a strong band 200 pounds. This allows you to work the lockout without changing your body position, which would normally occur with rack work at different pin heights.\nBecause of different body types and leverages, lifters have the ability to produce either a maximal or minimal force at the start, middle, or lockout. You have all seen this or experienced this. One lifter can be very strong at the start only to fail at lockout, while another lifter willstruggle to lift the bar off the floor, but will lock out the weight easily. Changes in joint angles will alter the conditions of muscular work when muscle length and the angle of the pull is changed. This subject is discussed in Supertraining (p 100).\nWe have made new‐found progress by doing rack pulls with plates 4‐6 inches and 2 inches off the floor with a pair of light bands folded up four times over the bar. The tension is very great. I have witnessed an 800‐pound deadlifter pull only 495 with light bands. However the lifters’ form is very similar to a regular deadlift, especially off low pins.\nIf your rack pull records are 600 on pin 1, 650 on pin 2, and 700 on pin 3, it took three workouts and three different starting positions. Now it can be done on one day with one workout and with a more reliable deadlift form. We are concentrating on the accentuated areas where maximum force occurs close to a particular joint angle. This system of variable resistance is a contrast method where the load is very different at different joint angles.\nWe combine many training systems. This falls directly into the conjugate system, which follows the objective of improving several motor skills that mimic the competitive lifts. It is said to be less effective with highly skilled lifters. Westside, with presently more than 75 Elite lifters, and the Dynamo Club of the former USSR, which had more than 70 highly skilled lifters, have found this to be just the opposite.\nTry band pulls off the floor or the rack to push to new heights. Bob Peoples, Paul Anderson, and Anthony Ditillo have paved the way with their early pioneering research. I plan to carry on their efforts and turn a vision into a reality.\nLouie Simmons",

I squatted 920 in 2000 at 52 years old. It was an uphill battle with the methods that I used up to 1983. After that I started using the sophisticated methods of the former Soviet Union. Even after a complete patella tendon rupture my squat went from 821 to 920.\nHow did I do it? There must be a plan. In mathematical terms, I am talking about volume and intensity. In addition, you need to determine what special exercises are needed and how much should be done.\nThe methods we developed at Westside are based on those of Soviet scientists, including Medvedyev, Verkhoshansky, Roman, Bompa, Kurz, and Komi, and on discussions I had with Siff, Tabachnic, and Zatsiorsky. All of these men have comprehensive yet practical books on the methodologies of strength training. I also had many useful discussions with Prof. Akita and Prof. Dellaquila (physics). These men have helped me greatly in the quest to become faster and stronger.\nI discovered that math was the missing link and wrote about Newton’s laws of motion, overspeed eccentrics, virtual force effects, and many other concepts. I made progress for 30 years. Chuck Vogelpohl went from a 575 to an 1150 squat at 264 for a period of 20 years. Now Matt Wenning, after joining the Club, has gone from 905 (11/05) to 953 (7/06) to 1003 (11/06) to 1055 (4/07). How does an old man make progress for 30 years, another for 20 years who is now 41 years old, and now a beginner who is 28?\nHere I explain a formula for band tension and bar weight that we use to accomplish our goals. For speed work, the barbell weight is roughly 40% of your max squat. The band tension is 25% at the top, or lockout, and about 10% at the bottom. An 800 squatter with gear would use 320 in bar weight. The band tension at lockout is 200 pounds, and the band tension at the bottom is 80 pounds. At the top, with bands and bar weight, the weight is 520, and on the box, it is 400. This combination enables accommodating resistance.\nA 1000‐pound squatter would load the bar to 400 plus 250 pounds of band loading. On the box, with band shrinkage, the tension would be 100 pounds. This makes the top combination 750 pounds and the bottom 500 pounds.\nChuck had an 1150‐pound world record squat at 264 body weight. For his speed work, he uses 575 pounds of bar weight. The band tension at the top is roughly 275 pounds. At the bottom, the band tension adds 150 pounds. The total weight at the top is 860, and at the bottom 725.\nFor the above three examples, for the 800‐pound squatter, the top is 65% and the bottom is 50%. For a 1000‐pound squatter the top is 75% and the bottom is 50%. For an 1150‐pound squatter, the ratio is 74% at the top to 63% at the bottom.\nExternal resistance is the main factor when bar speed is considered. This means the bar and band combination is very close regardless of the amount lifted. Just use half bar weight and half band tension. This is used for the dynamic effort workout. This system is used to develop a fast rate of force development. When lighter loads are used, the influence of max strength is reduced, and this leads to a maximal rate of force development, which is the same as explosive strength.\nThe band tension/barbell weight ratio for a near‐max, or circa‐max, phase is as follows. For an 800‐pound squatter, the band tension is roughly 375, and a max single on a parallel box is 515. At the top, or lockout, the combination adds up to 890 pounds.\nA circa‐max phase lasts 2 weeks of near‐max weights. The third week is a deload. The key is to be physically prepared to do near‐max sets and to be able to establish a new box squat record with the prescribed amount of bands.\nWeek 1: Warm up with the bar plus bands. We use a medium and a strong band on our Monolift with a 5 x 4 inch wood block attached to the bottom of the Monolift for added tension. Add weight and do doubles. After warming up, do 325 x 2 reps, 375 x 2 reps, 415 x 2 reps, and 465 x 1 rep. This is 7 lifts.\nWeek 2: After a warmup, do 325 x 2 reps, 375 x 2 reps, 375 x 2 reps, 415 x 1 rep, 465 x 1 rep, and if you can do a single with 515 on a parallel box, you will squat 800 at meet time. This depends on your form. If your form is good and your level of preparedness is high, you will succeed.\nThe ratio of box weight to band tension is 64% to 47%. A circa‐max cycle uses 90‐97% of a 1‐rep max. With a combination of band and weight at the top, it is 10% over your top squat, and if you are worrying about the bottom weight, don’t forget about the virtual force effect after the collision with the box.\nMany have squatted 900 pounds with the following program. They are able to do a max box squat with 595 pounds of bar weight and 375 pounds of band tension. A 2‐ week circa‐max phase is also used.\nWeek 1: After warming up with the bar and bands, do sets of 2 reps with 375, 415, 465, and 515 and a single with 565 on the box.\nWeek 2: After a warmup, do 375 x 2, 465 x 2, 545 x 1, and 595 x 1. The weight is 60% and the band tension is about 37%.\nA 1000‐pound squatter will have to make a 600‐pound box squat with 440 pounds of band tension. A 2‐week wave is used.\nWeek 1: After a warmup with the bar plus bands, do sets of 2 reps with 415, 465, and 515. Then do 1 rep with 565.\nWeek 2: Do 415 x 2, 515 x 2, 565 x 1, and 595 x 1.\nIf your GPP is high and your form is good, you will squat 1000 on contest day. Tony Bologne made 625 plus 440 pounds of band tension and did an easy 1035 squat at 308. Matt Wenning made a strong 625 and squatted an easy 1055 at 296 body weight.\nWe have two 1100+ squatters: Matt Smith, SHW, did 1141, and Chuck, at 264, did 1150. Chuck’s 1150 in 2007 was easy. His band tension was 600 pounds, which is 56% of 1150. His max box squat was 750 plus the bands; 750 is 65% of his 1150 world record squat. His sets looked like this:\nWeek 1: After a good warmup with the bar and bands, he does 505 x 2, 595 x 2, and 665 x 2.\nWeek 2: 505 x 2, 595 x 2, 705 x 1, and 750 x 1.\nAs in all other weeks, a download week is done with light weight and bands: 465 pounds of bar weight plus 250 pounds of band tension for 3 sets of 2 reps. The next week was the world record squat.\nLeading up to the meet, the squat day is always Friday and the max effort day is Monday. Three days separate intense days of training. When the circa‐max phase is employed, the max effort day is converted to special exercises for the glutes, hamstrings, hips, lats, and abs. This may consist of belt squats, the Reverse Hyper machine, glute/ham raises, pull‐throughs, sled pulling, lat work, and ab work, along with restoration methods and ways of making weight.\nWe have 11 lifters who squat more than 1000 pounds. One cannot dream of squatting 1000; a dream is just a dream. You must have a plan, a proven plan. We have established this through more than 20 years of training. I hope our plan can make your dream come true.\nLouie Simmons",

However, we don’t have an off-season; this would waste part of the year’s training. We are a private gvm and onlv powerlifters train here, with the exception of NFL prospects or sports teams that come to visit from around the world. But the fact is, some group is altvavs training for a meet. This means that their training partners must train with them regardless of their level of preparedness.\nI copied the Bulgarian svstem for our mas effort davs. Just like the Bulgarians, we like to max out on an exercise that we have established a record on, for example, floor press, Safety Squat bar, low box squat, or pin 2 rack deadlift. We may not be able to set a new record, but we do as much as we are capable of on that day. I am talking about the lifter who is going to the meet and also his training partners, who are not going to a meet. I believe this is a main reason that our group at westside is so strong.\nIf vou stop training for 2 weeks, you can possibly lose 10% of vour strength Who can afford to do that? A 1500 pound total would mean a reduction of 150 pounds. A 2300 total would show a loss of 230 pounds. We can’t afford this. Can vou?\nUnlike the top Bulgarians, we do several exercises with which we can max out, but very seldom the three competitive lifts. We do squats with many different bars (Safetv Squat bar, Buffalo bar, cambered bars) and with different apparatus (Manta Rev, front squat harness, bands, chains).\nFor benching, it’s the same process. Anv of the following. are done; 3 or 5 in. tampered bar, E-2 curt bar, dumbbells at different angles, board press with one to five boards, benching with five different band tensions, full-range band press, full-range chain press with three to five sets of chains, benching with the lightened method, foam box pressing with real weight and bands ever the bar.\nDur deadlifttraining is coupled with our squat training. Hack pulls, band pulls,\nlightened method deadlifts, and a variety of good mornings are used.\nRemember, when training with those who are going to meets and going through the circa-may phases, the other training partners must train along with them. The lifters who are not competing sometimes are training harder than those who are because of their level of preparedness. One can’t be at his or bar best at all times. But one must train as hard as possible all times, year in and year out.\nWe must always raise our general physical preparedness. This is a must if you want to reach the top in any sports endeavor. The training must be yery dense. This simply means that one must accomplish a lot in a training session. with short rest periods.\nMartin Runney said a pyramid is only as tall as its base. This is also true in any sport. Too many pay attention to special strength preparedness and not enough to general strength preparedness. This means that many of our max effort days are devoted to special exercises such as sled pulling. We do a wide variety of sled pulling: walking forward with the strap hooked to your power belt, walking backward with the strap hooked to your power belt, walking forward with the strap held in your hands at knee leyel or lower, and walking forward with the strap held in the hands, doing pressing motions. curling, pec work, or static holds in all positions. Upper body style holds will build upper body size, because you can breathe while holding statically for long time periods. This is great for football or hockey. too can also walk backward doing high pulls, upright rows, bent over rows, or external rotation exercises. We also do chins and dips; we have a machine that reduces your body weight while you do these ekercises.\nWe try to build muscle mass all year long as well as work on explosive speed and absolute strength, in addition to perfecting form in all three lifts. In a yearly plan that truly works, one must increase speed, work capacity, and of course absolute strength. With the conjugate method, all this is possible. There is truly never an off-season if you are aiming for greatness. If you don’t train for 2 weeks, your strength can drop 10%. If you don’t do sled work or tread sled work for 2 weeks, your work capacity will fail greatly. Eyen your flexibility will suffer if not maintained.\nLouie Simmons",

If you triple your velocity, the kinetic energy is 9 times as great. Without bands, a lifter will lower the bar in roughly 1 second. Using Jump-Stretch bands on the bar, the length of the eccentric phase can be cut in half, to 0.5 second. In plain terms, 500 pounds in contact with the box will cause a force of 750 pounds as a result of overspeed eccentrics.\nA further example occurs when sprinting. A 200-pound sprinter will experience a force per step of 200 pounds. However, while sprinting at top speed, he is able to produce 5 or 6 times body weight by overspeed eccentrics, caused by the speed of the foot colliding with the track. This is a virtual force effect, a force that is present but not recognized. Although bands do accommodate resistance—this is obvious to the observer—they also produce added kinetic energy to produce a powerful stretch reflex.\nI have written previously about optimal eccentric training. We all know that one can produce more muscle activation when lowering weight, up to 50% more. This is a good thing if you want added muscle soreness. But who wants that? Most hypertrophy occurs when lowering weights. One can lower more weight than one can raise. This is where the problem arises. Most tend to lower the barbell too slowly, destroying the stretch reflex. If towering the barbell slowly is correct, then depth jumps and plyometrics are wrong. And we know that plyometrics work, unquestioningly.\nAn experiment with Matt Smith, when his best contest squat was 930, was conducted with the help of Dr. Akita , a calculus professor. Matt first squatted with 550 pounds of barbell weight to a parallel box. The eccentric and concentric phases were roughly 0.90 second. Bands were added to the\nbar and the bar weight was reduced so that the total weight at the top of the lift was 750 and the weight on the box was 550. By the bands pulling down on the bar, causing an overspeed eccentric phase, the eccentric phase was reduced to 0.57 second and the concentric phase was 0.54 second. That’s right, 0.4 second faster with 200 pounds more resistance at the top and the same 550 pounds on the box. How? By increasing velocity.\nIf you triple your squat kinetic energy, the overspeed eccentrics causes a virtual force effect when contacting the box. Why is this important? Muscle tension on the eccentric phase can be lessened to some extent, although the resistance is reduced somewhat by band shrinkage. The added bar speed increases kinetic energy when contacting the box, much like weight releasers. Your brain thinks the weight or resistance is the same at the top as it is in the bottom. A benefit is that the band causes an accommodating resistance to the bar.\nFor me, the hardest part of a squat is unracking the bar from the Monolift. When the eccentric phase begins, all that eccentric muscle strength takes over. But how can optimal eccentrics be trained? One of the best methods is the lightened method. Here, two bands are connected to the top of the power rack. Depending on the band strength, a predetermined weight is reduced at the bottom of the lift. As the bar is lowered, some of the resistance is reduced, as is the muscle tension to some extent. A strong band at Westside will lighten the load 155 pounds. If only 155 pounds is on the bar at the bottom of the lift, one can totally relax all muscle tension at that point. This means that you go from relaxed to dynamic. This is one of the greatest ways to build explosive and absolute strength. Many will fight the bar eccentrically until fully lowered, but with this method, if you lower 310 pounds, it requires half the eccentric strength to lower the bar. In addition, you will learn to lower the bar faster, causing a greater stretch reflex. This method can be used for all power lifts and Olympic lifts.\nThere is a second method that can take enormous loads eccentrically by catching the bar or plates or even the lifter himself. It requires two foam blocks. The lifter takes the bar off bench racks and lowers it until the plates touch the blocks and sink into the foam. How far the plates sink into the foam depends on the bar weight. We have benched over 800 pounds by this method. Very heavy squats and good mornings are also done. This method breaks up the eccentric/concentric phase, which is a must for power and strength.\nWhen box squatting, we place a 7-inch foam pad on the box. As you sit on the foam, it sinks until you are sitting all the way on the box. The box itself represents a collision, producing kinetic energy for a strong stretch reflex. The foam causes a dampened effect. This promotes muscle work. If\nyou have ever run in sand, you know how much it fatigues the muscles. The foam has the same effect. I watched a tape of a world class thrower doing plyometrics on a gym floor with hard-sole weightlifting shoes. In a different segment, he was wearing cross-training shoes and the floor was covered with gym mats. This time his reaction time on the automazation phase was much slower. Why? He was using more muscle work on the mats and less connective tissue work. A top sprinter said that 80% of running comes from kinetic energy from the ligaments and tendons. But by doing both methods, the thrower is using all of his potential by jumping on both soft and hard surfaces.\nI thought why not squat and bench the same way. We now train mostly off a foam box, but always do the circa-max phase or an all-time P.R. off a hard box. We have used this method for 2 years with great success. You will see this progress on our website and on our record boards at the gym.\nFor deadlifting, stand on a thin foam pad and it will bring your legs into the lift. Give this a try and see the results for yourself.\nLouie Simmons",

The most recognized is the maximal effort method. This method produces the greatest strength gains by improv­ing intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. For near-max weight, 1 or 2 reps are used. For circa-max training, 2 reps are used. For true max effort training, 1 rep is best. If you can do 3 reps in a single set, this is referred to as the method of heav­y efforts, which we at Westside find inferior to the 1-rep true max. Note that the max effort weight may not be an all-time record, but the most that can be lifted regardless of your lev­el of preparedness.\nThe second method is the dynamic method. This method is used to replace a max effort workout. Submaximal weights are lifted with maximal speed. Remember, F = m x a. This method indirectly builds strength by increasing a fast rate of force dev­elopment and explosiv­e strength. Bands or chains must be used to reduce bar deceleration. Bands will also increase the eccentric phase, which helps build a superior stretch reflex phase. Reps must be low (1 for pulls, 2 for squats, and 3 for benching). Never go to failure. You must stop if the bar speed decreases. The bar weight or band or chain resistance must v­ary to cause a change in metabolic reactions and intramuscular coordination and changes in biometrical v­ariables. This is discussed in The Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. Zatsiorsky. The bar speed must be about 8 meters per second or more. The sets are no less than 6 and no 90 seconds between sets. This single method literately changed Westside Barbell in 1983, and we have refined it for 24 years.\nThe third method of training is the repetition method. Super Training by Mel Siff talks about many methods of training. Repetitions to failure are to be done to complete failure with no assistance from a training partner. This system is also used with machines. This is a waste of time. Machines should be used for rehab or prehab only. They work mostly on the peak contraction principle. This system is designed to focus the efforts on increasing muscular strength at the weakest point of the strength curv­e. Howev­er, by itself, it does not accommodate resistance. At Westside, we use the repetition method to near failure for sev­eral sets. Does this method work? I would not be talking about it if it didn’t. George Halbert has also experimented with this system. Remember, George has broken 11 world records in three weight classes. We use sev­eral different training systems and rotate them. The first I got from East German shot-putters. Do 4 sets of dumbbells with a weight you can do cold for 4 sets of 15 reps. For example, I did 24 reps with 100-pound dumbbells. I started with 70s and now use 85s for 4 sets of 15 reps cold. George started with 85s but could not do them. After about a month, he uses 11 Os for his sets. Remember, pick a weight you can do fairly easily cold for 4 sets of 15 reps. Do the sets before the dynamic and the max effort day and, also, before the dynamic squat day and the max effort squat/deadlift day. If this is too taxing, do this 3 times a week. For a second workout, do 2 sets of 15 reps with a power bar, 4 times a week. Again, use a weight that you can do cold, no warm-ups. I use 185 with one set with a close grip, index finger touching the smooth part of the bar, and the second set with a max or wider grip. Each workout, alternate doing wide or close grip first. Just like the d bell sets, change from flat, to incline or decline, to seated. I have seen amazing results. If you burn out on dumbbells, go to barbell sets. As you can see, these workouts are moderate. They increase muscle mass and work capacity .Not only powerlifters but also football, baseball, rugby, and almost every sportsman can benefit from this method. Again, do the sets at the beginning of the workout. This means before speed squats, max effort squat and deadlift, speed bench, or max effort work, and without a warm-up.\nFor rehab and prehab, we do dumbbells for time on a stability ball. A bench will also work. Pick 3 or 4 weights and do slow reps for a time record. I have done 40-pound dumbbells for 13 minutes and 100s for 2 minutes 45 seconds. Don’t do continuous reps. Rest at the top or bottom position and change the style of pressing, e.g., elbows out, elbows in, hammer curl press, rev­erse grip press. On max effort day, do 3 sets of max reps for a 1-set or 3-set record. First do a good warm-up before doing the max sets. When I could bench 500 without a bench shirt, I would use 100-, 125-, and 155-pound dumbbells. Our 550- 625 raw benchers use 125-, 155, and 175-pound dumbbells. George Halbert trains the bench 6 days a week. His speed day and max effort day are as usual. His approach is to train pushing exercises on one day and pulling exercises on the next. Tony Ramos and “Dollar Bill” use the same system. There are two extra days of pressing. These extra pressing days are either decline or incline dumbbell presses. They are done for 4 sets of 15 reps with an optimal weight. This is not too hard or too easy. When he’s not pressing, George does pullov­ers at v­arious angles, barbell rows, dumbbell rows, pull-ups with added weight, or dips or chins with reduced bodyweight on a special machine. When he’s not doing dumbbells or some type of back exercise, George also does a lot of cambered bar presses or uses an “arch” bar. This bar teaches you to use the upper back and to rotate and stretch the bar apart to utilize the triceps. As you can see, George uses the repetition method extensiv­ely in his training. Westside is almost solely dependent on special exercises, using the repetition method to near failure for many sets.\nRemember, you must use all three methods to build strength: the dynamic, max effort, and repetition method to near failure. All of these are used during a weekly, monthly, and yearly plan at Westside.\nLouie Simmons\nRead more: How to start a deadlift",

We had just had a serious blow dealt to us at Westside, losing four great lifters to injury and illness. When you lose lifters who have totaled more than 2200, 2300, 2400, and 2500, it’s hard to shake off. It was even harder to lose four good friends and training partners. We had to fill the void.\nI like to think it’s Westside versus the world. There’s Huge Iron’s Justin Garalf, Jim Grandick, Nick Hatch, and their coach, Rich Hussey, to worry about. The Finns are getting stronger all the time, led by Ano Turtiainen. If that’s not enough to worry about, now the Ukrainians are coming to the WPO. Yevheniy Yarymbash has already broken the total record at 275 with an unreal 2635. Then there’s Oleksandr Kutcher at 165. His 870 squat, 540 bench, and 793 deadlift are not from another country, but another planet. By the way, Kutcher and the rest of the Ukrainians presented me with the Ukrainian symbol of power. This is one of the most prized possessions I have ever received. Thank you very much, Mr. Kutcher. Why am I rambling on about our losses and the great lifters coming from everywhere? Because we are looking for a few good lifters who want to become great. But first 1’ 11 talk about the four that decided to come to Westside.\nMatt Wenning, from Ball State University, had been visiting Westside for 7 years. After receiving his Master’s degree, he moved to Columbus to train here. One year ago, his total was 2175 at 275, at the IPA Nationals in November 2005. In November at the WPO, he totaled 2402. His squat went from 900 to 1005. His 600 bench press increased to 680. and after pulling a meager 600. he smoked 755 in New York to hit that 2402. How did he do it? His squat form was not that good. He was always going down, then back, instead of going back, then down. Lots of sled work, glute/ham raises, and the Reverse Hyper machine helped fix this problem. We thought his bench press was slow, so we reduced his speed work form 245 plus bands to 205 plus bands. The result was an 80-pound PR with room for improvement. The real problem was his deadlift. He had done a 700 deadlift in 2004, but\nby deadlifting too much, he aggravated his back to the point that he could not deadlift in the Detroit APF Senior Nationals and made only 600 at the IPA Nationals in York in 2005. Training sumo style with bands off the floor, regular and ultra wide, saved his lower back and built up the muscle groups that he lacked: hips and glutes. The result was a 155-pound jump at the WPO semifinals in New York\nin 2006, while still at 275. Matt has learned a lot about his training and his teammates’ training to further their advancement as well. Matt has now settled in Columbus, buying a house, while maintaining a thriving personal training business.\nThe next to join up was Phil Harrington. Phil had already broken the world record in the squat several times. After moving to Columbus and training at Westside, he broke not only his squat record again but also his deadlift, with an easy 670 at 181. Like Matt. Phil’s squat form was a bit off. He did wide box squats, and keeping his chest up and pushing the glutes out to the rear first changed his form for the better. For Phil’s deadlift, form work was first employed. He concentrated on pushing his knees out to the sides, pulling back the bar, and not rushing or jerking it. For strength work, glute/ ham raises, the Reverse Hyper machine, sled pulling, and box jumps were used. For the bench, we had a lot of work to do. First, Phil was reverse-grip benching because of a shoulder injury. After most of the work where it is needed: on the arms. This reduced the stress on his shoulders, and now his bench press is moving again. His goal is to break the total record at 181 and then move up to 198. With Arnold Coleman at Westside, Phil is always looking over his shoulder.\nLaura Phelps has joined Westside to team up with Amy Weisberger. First. Laura squatted 725, benched 405, and deadlifted 510 to total 1640 at 164 body weight, which equals 10 times body weight. She later benched 465 at 176 body weight, an all-time bench record. For squatting, she does a lot of band work off a foam box. This helped turn potential into reality. She has perfect squat\nform. Laura looks like she was born to squat. George Halbert has worked extensively with Laura’s bench, and the results speak for themselves. Learning to release her muscles on the eccentric phase has paid off. She found that a strong upper back is essential if you want to use strong triceps while bench- ing. Her deadlift has gone up quickly due to selecting the right exercises. The Reverse Hyper machine, glute/ham raises, and ultra wide sumo pulls have been beneficial. The sky’s the limit with support from Shane, her boyfriend, and all of Westside behind her.\nGreg Panora came to Westside after waiting 10 years. He knew he wanted to train at Westside when he was 15 years old. He did alright on his own, totaling 2255 in the 242’s. His best lifts were a 920 squat, a 600 bench, and a 770 deadlift. Not bad, but after moving to Columbus and working with some of our top lifters, he made a 2369 at the Las Vegas APF Nationals in 2006. This was after less than 8 weeks of training. At a meet in Fremont, Ohio, he squatted 1000, benched 680, and deadlifted 800. That’s a world record total of 2485 at 288 body weight. He drove to the meet in the middle of the night and weighed in at 9:00 a.m. and was squatting at 11:00 a.m. At the WPO semifinals n New York in November, he squatted 1003, was red-lighted with 1025, benched a strong 688. and pulled 749. He missed 799 at the knees. The Arnold Classic is next for Greg. Greg’s bench has come a long way. His form was good, but his arms needed work. He did a lot of triceps extensions of all kinds. Kettle bell extensions have really increased his lockout. He does full-range band press and dumbbell presses at all angles. Working lats and upper back with Chuck Vogelpohl has paid dividends. Greg had never used a Reverse Hyper machine or done band pulls, and just like Laura, wide sumo deadlifts are developing his lockout. We really worked on Greg s squat form. It had cost him a 1025 squat at the WPO semis, which cost him another world record total. This makes his squat form a priority.\nWe are lucky to have four new lifters like these to fill the void. Now that you have read what these four have done, are you up to the task? We are always looking to fortify Westside. It’s fun but not easy. If you want to reach the top, Westside could be your gateway to glory. We are looking especially for lightweights. It’s hard to find anyone under 148 in the U.S. With Westside having 19 700 + benchers, nine doing over 1000 in the squat and two over 1100, and 13 800+ deadlifters, large weights for a smaller person would seem light. We have plenty of heavyweights to push anyone to their limit. There can be no excuses. The U.S. has to pick it up fast to survive in world powerlifting. Other sports are falling behind: baseball, basketball, and boxing. Don’t let powerlifting do the same.\nLouie Simmons",

Unfortunately, most have misused a system in order to peak for a meet. Progressive gradual overload, or Western periodization, is based on a hypothetical goal. So, at any time, the percent of your contest max may be off by as much as 20%. Many times the lifter is missing weights 3 weeks from the contest. This is because their expectations are too high or possibly too low. Training should be calculated by using a formula based on math, not dreams. I suggest everyone read books on periodization by noted authors such as Tudor Bompa or Vladimir Zatsiorsky. These books explain periodization in terms of micro- and mesocycles. After all, periodization is a reference to the division of training into a yearly plan, or even a 4-year plan, i.e., an Olympic cycle.\nThis system is used for weight lifting, powerlifting, and track and field, and of course should be used for all sports requiring the development of power. The former Soviet Union had so much data on training that they did not know what some top coaches were doing. Mel Siff (`!Supertraining`!) asked how I arrived at our 3-week pendulum system. It was quite similar to that used by the great Soviet Union SHW champion Vasily Alexeev. I stated that after 3 weeks we could not become faster or stronger, so we waved back down and started over. Mel said that Alexeev found the same to be true.\nSo with the help of Russian and Bulgarian research and that done at Westside with over 70 Elite powerlifters, plus feedback from some of the greatest powerlifters around the world, our loading is based on A. S. Prilepin’s table. For speed work for benching we do 9 sets of 3 reps. This is known as the dynamic effort method. Its purpose is to build a fast rate of force development. For squatting, the sets vary from 12 without bands or chains (i.e., a contrast method) to as low as 3 for the last week of a circa-max phase. The reps are always 2. For speed pulls, the reps are 1 and the sets are 5-8.\nThe powerclean and snatch are commonly used to develop speed strength in high schools and colleges, but the powerlifts can be used for the same purpose. For the bench the bar speed should be a minimum of 0.75 meters/second (m/s) and a maximum of 1.0 m/s. Jeremiah Meyers and John Stafford have pulled 495 at 1.2 m/s for sets. To find your total loading volume, multiply the sets by the number of reps.\nFor example, 9 sets of 3 reps for benching with 200 pounds on dynamic day is 5400 pounds. One should always use chains or bands to accommodate resistance and help reduce bar deceleration. For squatting, 12 sets of 2 reps with 500 pounds is 12,000 pounds. Only training sets should be calculated. At Westside we follow the “rule of 60%”. An extreme workout should occur every 72 hours. The max effort day will be about 60% of the dynamic day. This may sound easy to do, but stop and add the weights used on max effort day using weights of 70% up to max weight lifted, and you will be surprised how low the total volume is. We lift about 45 to 50% on average. The rule of 60% was introduced through Olympic lifting.\nPowerlifting training requires one to make much larger jumps. This makes it almost impossible to lift 60% of the total volume on max effort day. At Westside we don’t use the method of heavy efforts, where 2 reps of multiple sets are used. Using the conjugate system, we try an all-time max each week on a special core exercise. If you repeatedly use the same core exercise, you will regress, if training above 90% of a 1-rep max. The conjugate system was first used at the Dynamo Club in the former Soviet Union. They had 70 highly qualified lifters from whom to gather input. At Westside we have had over 70 Elite powerlifters who have provided data over the years, in addition to many highly skilled athletes from all sports, just like the Dynamo Club.\nThe training cannot be a flat loading system; that is, the volume cannot be the same when the intensity goes from a low of 60-70% to a high of 90-100%. Through years of experience, it is known that to gain better results, one can increase the training load. This can be done by increasing the number of workouts, increasing volume, and raising intensity, making workouts more complex through special exercises. Periodization plays different roles in training. At Westside we use a 3-week pendulum wave. After 3 weeks, we failed to become stronger or faster. To use the wave, go up in bar weight for 3 weeks using 8-10 sets with the suit straps down. Base the weight on a contest max: use 50%, 55%, and 60% over the 3 weeks. Then wave back to 50% the following week. Using weights based on a box squat max, use 75%, 80%, and 85%. For a preparatory phase that lasts 9 weeks, with a Safety Squat bar max of 640, it looks like this. First wave 325 light band–70 pounds of tension 415 8 sets 10 sets 2 reps 375 10 sets 2 reps 2 reps 2 reps\n2 reps Second wavemed. band–140 pounds of tension 325 375 10 sets 2 reps 415 8 sets 2 reps\nThird wavestrong band–260 pounds of tension 325\n375 8 sets 2 reps 415 6 sets 2 reps 10 sets 8 sets You can switch bars to a 14-inch cambered bar, front squat, Manta Ray, or a regular squat bar for a 3-week wave, increasing bar weight or chain or band weight, or a combination. For the strength speed cycle, a rule to follow is 2 weeks. To do this, use about 50% band tension and 50% bar weight. Joe Bayles did a 2-week wave for strength speed with 520 pounds of band tension and 505 pounds of bar weight on a parallel box using 4 sets of 2 reps on week 1 and 3 sets of 2 reps on week 2 with 545 in bar weight and 520 in band tension. Going longer than 2 weeks for strength speed is too taxing on the CNS. For speed strength Chuck Vogelpohl uses 440 pounds on the bar plus 110 pounds of band tension on the box and 260 pounds of tension at the top. This is done for a 3-week wave for 10 sets the first 2 weeks and 8 sets the third. The bar weight goes to 480 for week 2 and 520 for week 3. A speed strength cycle precedes a strength speed cycle. A speed strength cycle should precede a circa-max cycle.\nWith two major meets a year, a circa-max wave will last 3 weeks. The bar weight is 47.5%, 50%, and 52% of your contest best, with 40-45% band tension. Week 1: 435 x 5 sets of 2 reps plus 440 pounds of band tension. Week 2: 485 x 4 sets of 2 reps plus 440 pounds of band tension. Week 3: Work up to a max single. “Dollar Bill”, a 308, and Phil Harrington, a 181, have done 600 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension to squat 900 and 905, respectively, at a meet. Phil’s 905 was a world record at 181. These results are very reliable. The math reveals that your contest squat is about one-third higher than your box squat max with the suit straps down and no knee wraps. The results will vary about 3% either way.\nGreg Panora made a box squat with 645 plus 440 pounds of bands to squat 1000 at 238 and total 2485, a world record at 242. The larger the squat, the greater the band tension must be. The band tension must be great on the box as well. We use a 2-week wave for a circa-max cycle if three large totals are attempted in one year. Greg won the 2006 APF Nationals with an improvement from 2255 to 2369. In September, Greg made a 2485 total. For the September meet, Greg did 505 for 2 sets of 2 reps and 555 for 2 sets of 2 reps with 440 pounds of band tension on week 1. Week 2, he worked up to 645 with 440 pounds of band tension. He squatted 1000 pounds at the meet, a 60-pound PR. Remember, you must have good form on both a box and a contest squat and be mentally prepared as well as being in a highly trainable state.\nTraining for a meet will take its toll on anyone. A period of 1-2 weeks to download the total volume and intensity must occur. This period is referred to as the delayed transformation phase. Don’t take heavy weights 1-2 weeks before a meet. All this does is show a lack of confidence. If you are worried about your opener, you must be scared to death to take a third attempt in front of real judges. For benching on the dynamic method day, every 3 weeks change the reactive method that you use, e.g., stronger bands for 3 weeks or more chains each week for 3 weeks or adding weight to weight releasers each week. The bar weight must stay the same.\nFor speed deadlift pulls, the bar weight is 50% of your max deadlift and 30% band tension at the top. For deadlifts the band tension remains the same, but raise the bar weight slightly for 3 weeks, then return to the original weight. The max effort for improving the squat, bench, or deadlift must be rotated each week. A 1-week plan is always used for max effort day. The conjugate system was intended for highly skilled lifters, but at Westside, when we start a new lifter who shows promise, he is placed in one of our groups and trains just like the advanced, and it has yet to fail. One-week and 3-week cycles are arranged to produce high results at meets, where they count.\nA yearly plan must be divided into 1-week and 3-week plans to fit a year of competition. It doesn’t matter how strong you are before a meet or after a meet. It counts only on meet day. With 13 lifters with totals above 2300 and 5 over 2500, our system has served us well.\nLouie Simmons",

Although they have been around forever, they have once again become the rage. There are kettle bell camps and certifications. Pavel has several DVDs on kettle bell workouts for strength training and flexibility. Zach Evan- Esh has an excellent DVD on combat training with kettle bells. He has really thought out a system for conditioning and strength endurance.\nBut what does Westside do with kettle bells?\nWe do very few kettle bell swings and cleans. At the Arnold Classic, I arranged with Kieran Kidder to have Valery Fedorenko do a demonstration. He jerked a 70 pound kettle bell for an unbelievable 2006 reps! Once he cleaned the first rep, he never touched the floor again until the last rep was completed.\nKettle bells are good for mobility, flexibility, and strength endurance, as noted by the 2006 reps made at the WPO finals. At Westside, some will do a few swings for a warm-up on dynamic squat day or max effort day for squatting or deadlifting. A few will do some cleans or snatches on these same days.\nFor shoulder therapy we do them with the bottoms up. Here the lifter holds the handles tight while stabilizing the bells with the bottom of the kettle bell on top. Thanks to Pavel for this one. We also do kettle bell bench shrugs with the bottoms up. For shoulder traction, bend over holding onto a kettle bell. With your arm straight rotate the shoulder internally and externally. This will help most rotator injuries.\nFor GPP we work up to a half mile holding the kettle bells. It’s great for grip and shoulder traction. Passing a kettle around the body is very therapeutic for the shoulders as well.\nWe do a lot of presses from incline, decline, and seated positions, a few flyes, and a lot of triceps extensions with the kettle bells. Because the bell is either in front of or behind the wrist, this makes pressing very awkward but effective. To make the exercises more difficult, we double up a set of mini-bands through the handles and do the exercises by holding the doubled-up mini- bands. This causes the kettle bells to move in all directions, creating a chaotic movement. This system will not only build superhuman strength but also build stability, and with light to moderate weights, this is very therapeutic.\nTony Ramos took it a step further by attaching the bands and kettle bells to the bar for all types of pressing. First, it truly teaches you to press correctly. This is accomplished by contracting all the pressing muscles. This includes the arms, delts, lats, and chest. To most effectively use kettle bells for bar pressing, double up a mini-band around the handle of each kettle bell and hang them from the bar. This can be very taxing and very precarious. Be sure to use spotters.\nWe have experimented with kettle bell and band pressing for over a year. It works. While lowering the bar to the chest, you of course must stop the bar from accelerating, but now you must stop not only the bar but also the kettle bells. This is not easy, as the bands’ elasticity causes the bells to lower further even as the bar stops. The bells continue to move not only downward but in all directions, as an oscillating pendulum, creating a chaotic state (as noted by Joe Dell’Aquilo, Ph.D., physics). After reaching lock-out, the bells continue to move upward. All the pressing muscles must work together, as they seldom do, to provide stability.\nLight weights and high reps will rehabilitate the pecs and delts. Do those before you suffer any injuries as prehabilitation? Heavy weights for lower reps will build muscle mass and great strength. I suggest you try this combination of weight, bands, and kettle bells. It is not just for the powerlifters but also for ball players and fighters of all types.\nLouie Simmons",

We have 17 benching over 700: one has done 830 (Mike Wolf), in addition to two 198’s who have done a 683 (George Halbert) and a 655 (Jayson Fry), and a 181 (Fred Boldt) who has done 628 and is an Arnold Classic winner. Then there’s Nick Winters, who made 650 raw at the New England Strength Spectacular.\nIn 1993 I wrote an article entitled “Three of a Kind”. We had three guys benching 600, one of whom (Kenn Patterson) went on to become the youngest to bench 700, at 22. His actual lift was 728, a world record at 275. Then along came Mike Brown. At 19 years old, he made 735 at 308and totaled 2300.\nHere are some of the routines and exercises they use.\nFirst, everyone does speed work. This is known as the dynamic method. This alone will not make you strong, but rather build a fast rate of force development. Research shows that 154 pounds can develop 264 pounds of force with maximal acceleration.\nNine sets are performed: 3 sets with the index finger on the smooth part of the bar, 3 sets with a 2 inch wider grip, and 3 sets with the little finger on the power ring.\nAfter speed bench, using about 40% of a 1-rep max on the floor press, they do 2 sets to near failure with one of three dumbbell weights. Fred uses either 155, 125, or 100 pound dumbbells. Sometimes a barbell is used. Fred’s weights are 365, 315, or 275. Remember, they go to near failure. Then it’s triceps, lats, upper back, and rear and side delts. Some hammer curls finish the workout.\nSpeed work can be waved by using 2 sets of 5/8 inch chains to accommodate resistance or mini-bands, which add 45 pounds in the bottom and 85 pounds at the top of the lift. A monster mini provides 110 pounds at the top and 50 pounds in the bottom. Speed benching can be done off rack pins, in the floor press, or with a cambered bar.\nNow let’s look at what some of Westside’s top benchers do.\nJay Fry has made incredible progress in a short time, going from 530 to 650 at 181 in less than 18 months, plus 655 at a body weight of 193. Jay has become quite a student of the game while working with George Halbert. To raise absolute strength, he uses heavy assistance work such as kettle bell triceps extensions and J. M. presses. This teaches him to fire the correct muscles at the right time. Using chains or bands or hang- ing kettle bells from the bar not only allows the muscles to become stronger but develops muscle coordination for benching. Jay feels this is far more important than just throwing heavy weight around.\nTo test his strength, Jay uses full-range band presses, floor presses with chains or bands, or just weight. These records are dependent on the special exercises that were mentioned above. Jay does a lot of upper body sled work. This makes him stronger and raises his GPP. The sky is the limit for Jay. His potential is very high, and with his drive, only time will tell.\nJays’s teammate Fred Boldt has been at Westside for close to 5 years. Fred’s bench went from 400 at 165 to 556 at 165, placing him second to the great Marcus Schick. He then won the 2005 WPO semifinals with a 628, over Jay’s 622, in Chicago. He went on to winning the\nArnold Classic in 2006 with 628. It’s not easy to win the Arnold with all the chaos that goes along with it.How does Fred do it? To test his bench press max, he tries a max off the floor press with 5 sets of chains weigh- ing 200 pounds on the bar. His best is 345 with his little fingers on the power ring on the bar. A second strength test is a full-range bench with light Jump-Stretch bands that add 100 pounds in the bottom and 200 pounds at lock-out. His best is 370. This is what Jay has also done, and their bench presses are very close.\nOf course, like all Westsiders, Fred uses the conjugate method. He will rotate from 4 or 5 boards with bands to a steep incline with a barbell. Fred uses a cambered bar on boards to reduce the camber to 1 inch.\nFor hypertrophy work, Fred likes dumbbell presses. His 1-set record is 34 reps with 100 pounds. He rotates three dumbbell weights: 100, 125, and 155 pounds. His best 3-set record is 14, 12, and 9 reps with 155’s. He also has done 104 push-ups with his feet elevated 12 inches.\nFred’s speed work is done with 185 or 205 plus mini-bands that add 85 pounds at lock-out or with 2 sets of 5/8 inch chain that when locked out is roughly 60 pounds.\nFor special work, straight bar extensions and kettle bell extensions are his mainstay. He does lots of lat and upper back work and rear and side delt work.\nFred never misses a workout (nor does anyone at Westside). Fred’s motivation is his desire to destroy Jay. I’m sure you will see Fred for a long time to come.\nMike Wolf made rapid progress after coming to Westside. His 585 soon became 825 and then 830. Mike is huge, about 405 pounds. George started working with Mike, finding his weaknesses. First George had Mike push up the triceps work and board press with lots of bands, up to 400 pounds of bands, plus weight. Mike also did full-range band presses–flat, incline, and decline. At Westside, we do a lot of triceps extension: straight bar, dumbbells with palms facing in, roll back style, dumbbells with elbows out to the sides, J.M. presses, and kettle bell extensions. Mike also does a lot of benches with kettle bells hanging from the bar with doubled up mini- bands. Mike found his floor press well below our average for his shirt bench. So he pushed it up to 515 with 200 pounds of chain, and this raised his bench considerably. Lots of lat work, pull-downs, bar rows, and dumbbell rows have made it possible for Mike to control the bar placement on his chest.\nLast is speed work. A fast rate of force develpment is essential to lift heavy weights fast. Let’s see if Mike can give Westside its first 900 bench.\nGeorge Halbert is our most decorated bencher: 11 all-time world records in three\ndifferent weight classes. George’s views on benching are as follows. Speed work is most important. George knows that if you miss a heavy lift, it was not too heavy, but was not lifted fast enough. His speed work consists of chains, bands, and hanging kettle bells from the bar.\nFor max effort work, it’s heavy band presses at all angles. This sometimes includes benching almost upside down; reverse or lightened band presses–flat, incline, or decline; board presses (without shirt); and lots of dumbbells. He also does the repetition method to near failure for 15 reps with hanging kettle bells.\nGeorge is very innovative in his training. His bench methods are responsible for much of Westside’s benching success. He does many workouts a week, just lats or delts or prehab work. He is one of only a few men, who have made world records in three weight classes, and he’s got more up his sleeve than just triceps.\nLouie Simmons",

A light band hung over the Monolift will reduce the load around 200 pounds in the bottom of the squat. Remember, we always box squat just below parallel. A monster mini will reduce the load 110 pounds, and a mini-band will unload the bar about 55 pounds.\nIf our intention is to become stronger, we start with the mini-bands. We add weight for 3 weeks and wave back and start a second 3-week wave with the monster minis. Again, we wave back and start a new 3-week wave with the light bands. The stronger the band, the greater the contrast. A 9-week wave would look like this. With a mini-band at the top: week\nweight\nsets\nreps\nweight at top\nweight at bottom 1\n455\n8\n2\n455\n400 2\n505\n8\n2\n505\n450 3\n555\n6\n2\n555\n505 4\n605\n8\n2\n605\n495 5\n655\n8\n2\n655\n545 6\n705\n6\n2\n705\n595 With a light band at the top: 7\n755\n8\n2\n755\n555 8\n805\n8\n2\n805\n605 9\n855\n6\n2\n855\n655 This series of squats is done off a box just below parallel. The rest between sets is 1 minute 15 seconds to 1 minute 30 seconds. We use this system at Westside on a regular basis. It is less taxing on the body. It is important to learn acceleration. It is even more important to change the rate of acceleration. The lightened method is just one way to accomplish this.\nThis method is also used on max effort day as one of our rotations. Tim Harold made a lightened method squat of 1115 at the top and 1000 at the bottom. His best squat is 1005. Matt Smith has used the same method with 1150 at the top and 1035 on the box, which has produced a 1102 squat. As you can see, Tim’s effort falls short of Matt’s, but this sets a standard to realize a contest potential. Although this method was used for youth training in the old Soviet Union, at Westside it is used in many of our exercises with great success. It has helped produce two 1100 squats, one at 268, Chuck Vogelpohl (a world record), plus five 1000-pound squats.\nWestside often uses the lightened method in the bench press. For benching we use four different strength bands. For max effort work we primarily use the strong bands and the medium bands. The bands are choked at the top of a 7-foot power rack. This reduces the bar weight at the chest by 155 pounds. With 455 pounds on the bar, the weight is reduced to 300 at the chest, but the weight is reloaded progressively until lockout, which is again 455.\nIn a second max effort workout we would use a medium band, to reduce the load 95 pounds at the bottom. After unracking the bar loaded to 455, it reduces to 350 at the chest and returns to 455 at lock-out. A light band at the top of the rack will reduce the load at the chest by 65 pounds. This time 455 at the top will weigh 390 at the chest. As you can see, the greater the band strength, the greater the contrast. This system builds speed or absolute strength depending on band tension.\nFor speed benching we use a light band or a monster mini-band. A 500- pound raw bencher would use a bar weight of 315. Light bands would reduce the bar weight to 250, or 50%, at chest level. This is a good alternative to other speed work. The three most common are bands, chains, and weight releasers.\nFor pulling, we use a strong band looped over a pin 5 feet 6 inches off the ground, which will unload the bar at floor level about 135 pounds. Joe Bayles pulled 745 with the lightened method. This resulted in a 775 P. R. at a meet. This was greater than a 30-pound positive result. Tim Harold pulled 900 pounds and later pulled 855 at a meet, which was a P. R., but a 45-pound negative result. Regardless, this will give some guidelines to go by.\nThis method is also very good for high pulls as well as increasing the second pull. Kneeling cleans, snatches, and squats are used in the same way.\nUse you imagination. You can use the lightened method for J. M. presses, triceps extensions, overhead presses, inclines, and declines. It is a fanastic tool for all sports. It will increase not only your vertical jump and long jump but also your hand speed. It teaches you to accelerate throughout the entire range of motion. Conventional weight training has a distinct deceleration phase. The lightened method will help eliminate this phenomenon. Look at it this way. With this method, a young ball player can unrack 135 in the squat, but at the bottom it weighs nothing; 225 at the top would be 90 pounds in the bottom; 315 at the top would be 180 in the hole, and so forth. This teaches acceleration.\nOne must take advantage of all training methods to succeed. People are getting stronger every day and are smart enough to make the most of their equipment. Don’t be a hater. Take advantage of everything at your disposal. If the great lifters of the 70s, 80s, and 90s had shirts and suits, you can bet the bank they would use them. Some of these lifters lasted only 5 or 6 years. If they had modern-day gear, maybe they would still be competing with today’s stars.\nLouie Simmons",

The Dynamic Method. This method develops and improves a fast rate of force development, or explosive strength. Approximately 60-90 lifts per month should be devoted to explosive strength.\nThe Repetition Method. We use the repetition method to near failure. The number of reps should be limited to just before the point of failure. It is not intended for the squat, deadlift, bench press, clean, or snatch, but rather special exercises such as lat work, tricep work, back extension work, ab work, and exercises that attempt to isolate a muscle group.\nYou cannot determine a 1-rep max from a rep max. Why? Men and women possess different muscle types. The more fast twitch, the worse one will be with reps because they hold less oxygen per cell. Someone who has an abundance of slow twitch fiber will have greater endurance\nbecause they can’t contract the muscle as intensely. In addition, a novice cannot use as much muscle fiber as an advanced lifter.\nEvery one should know that HIT (high-intensity training) is really low-intensity training, by looking at the intensity zones. High intensity is defined as 1 to 2 reps at 90% and above. Doing 8 or more reps is low intensity. When doing high repetitions, you produce less force with each rep. When lifting 300 pounds in the bench for reps, each successive rep has less force. If you go to failure and miss with the 300-pound bench, it should be obvious that the missed rep produced less than the 300 pounds of force. This system builds muscular endurance in a fatigued state.\nMaximal Effort Method. Using this method, one works up to a 1-rep max in a barbell exercise: rack pull, box pull, floor press, incline press, low box squat, parallel box squat, etc. At Westside, our maximal effort method is copied after the Bulgarian system: the most weight lifted on a particular training day. This may not be an all-time max, but rather the max weight lifted depending on your state of preparedness. If your best floor press is 500 and you make a true max single of 480, you are at 96% of your best. One should always be at least at 90% of your best, or it becomes too strenuous to regain top form.\nAfter a good warmup, 3 lifts are performed, one at about 90%, then one at near max or a small max, then one more. For Olympic lifting, the lifts done at greater than 90% are 4-10, according to A. S. Prilepin’s findings. Our findings at Westside for near-max work or circa-max lifts are that Prilepin’s chart works fine, but when attaining a true absolute max, no more than 3 lifts should be performed. This is because powerlifts take longer to perform.\nThis means that the time under tension is much longer. After gathering this information for the past 35 years, this is our conclusion.\nDid you know that the dynamic effort method was designed to replace a max effort workout? Both are extreme and must be separated by 72 hours. Both workouts are accompanied by 3 or 4 special exercises. The Westside system allows you to become faster, bigger, and stronger continuously throughout the year.\nDid you know that speed and quickness are determined by external resistance? No one tries to lift a heavy weight slowly, as Fred Hatfield said. Olympic lifting is a speed-strength sport, but requires great strength. In powerlifting, one must lift great loads. While these loads appear to move slowly, explosive strength is a must. In the United States, every university does some Olympic lifting. I ask them why. Their reply is that it builds explosive power. But in Europe, particularly in the old C.C.C.P., who invented the term “explosive power”, they never mention using the Olympic lifts. Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, who invented shock training, or, as we call it, plyometrics, talks about bounding, jumping, plyometrics, and depth jumps–jumping off a high platform, resulting in a high-speed landing- -but never Olympic lifts.\nIn the book Explosive Power and Jumping Ability for All Sports by T. Starzynski and H. Sozanski, Olympic lifting is never discussed. Starzinski coached two Olympic gold medalists, and Sozanski is a coach and professor specializing in problems of training for jumping ability. Seated barbell press off the floor is illustrated in their book.\nDid you know that there are much better exercises than the standard Olympic lifts, as follows. Kneeling squats. After kneeling down with the heels touching the glutes, jump into a full squat. Kneeling power cleans. The next progression is the kneeling power snatch.\nKneeling split snatch and kneeling power snatch.\nStraight leg power clean and snatch and clean.\nPower snatch while sitting with the bar across the legs.\nWe have a thrower who trains with us occasionally who can do a kneeling jump squat with 255. John Stafford has jumped onto a 35-inch box with a pair of 70-pound dumbbells.\nWe concentrate on box squatting and using the contract and reactive methods. Thomas Kurz has stated in The Science of Sports Training that to develop explosive strength, explosive efforts can be used, such as jumps, shotput, or jerking dumbbells or a barbell. “But it is easiest and safest to increase it by increasing maximal strength.”\nDid you know that a wide stance squat works the quads to the same degree as a close stance squat, but with the bonus of using more hip, glute, and hamstring muscles? Anyone who tries to squat as much as possible soon learns that a wide stance produces greater results. This was proven at a test at Ball State University.\nDid you know almost all college and high school football teams do power cleans and power snatches, yet they are not used in the NFL combines?\nDid you know that when lifting barbells, there is a deceleration phase? For this reason, you must use Jump-Stretch bands or chains. They accommodate resistance. When joint angles become more favorable, such as at lockout, one can lift considerably more weight. With barbell weight, the bar can be too heavy at the start to generate sufficient acceleration to complete the lift, or the bar can be too light and as it nears completion, the barbell slows down, causing a deceleration. The bands\nalso can be used as a contrast method. As the bar descends, the band tension decreases. As one rises concentrically, the bands increase the load, causing a contrasting load difference. The contrast and reactive methods must be used for the development of speed strength and explosive power.\nDid you know that attaching bands to the bar produces an overspeed eccentric phase? Why is this important? When velocity is tripled, a 9 times greater kinetic energy is produced. It has been proven (Samoyloff, Kisseliff, 1928; O. Foerster, Altenlurgey, 1933; Lippold, 1957) that the stretch reflex (or the myotactic reflex) has great value for increasing the effect of eccentric work. This proves the great contribution to overspeed eccentrics.\nDid you know that muscles contact harder and faster the higher their temperature?\nDid you know that Westside has only two men on its staff:\nJohn “Chester” Stafford and Matt Wenning? John talks about nutrition on his Web site. He has, I believe, the biggest push-pull for a 275-pounder: a 733 bench and a 832 deadlift, in addition to a 2502 total. Matt Wenning is a graduate of Ball State University with a Masters in biomechanics and has already made a 950 squat, a 650 bench, and a 725 deadlift at 275. These two people, along with myself, are the only qualified people to talk about the real truth of what goes on at Westside.\nWe see the evolution of strength training every day, and every day it changes for the betterment of our lifters. If you follow our articles and talk to me occasionally, you know that the experiments we conduct are performed on our top men at two or three major meets to prove that the tested methods work. I don’t write B.S.; I write about what I see at Westside. Some things work, some don’t. We put forth a lot of effort to help our lifts, and I hope yours. I appreciate how cooperative our lifters are, young and old, and how loyal they are. Some have been here for years. Bob Coe has been here over 20 years, and Chuck Vogelpohl, Amy Weisburger, and Jimmy Richie for 20 years.\nDid you know that Westside contributes to the development of many sports. A former top soccer player from Manchester United stayed at Westside for more than a month to learn our system. After returning home, Ben Plevey opened up a training facility to pass on the system to young athletes in his home country.\nFour rugby coaches from all over the world spent considerable time at Westside, and the results have been quite favorable to say the least.\nMany pro football players come to Westside and have made great strides. Also, many major universities have adapted the Westside system to fit their needs. Did you know that the football players never ask me to make them faster, but ask to become stronger?\nMaking them stronger makes them faster. There would not be a Westside if not for the likes of Huge Iron, Donny Thompson, Spud Barkly, Paul Childress, Andy Bolton, with his 971 deadlift, and Jeff Lewis, with his 1200+ squat. Because of them and many like them, we never miss a workout for fear that some of you dudes are working on a secret of your own. I am proud to be associated with powerlifting, and I hope you are too.\nAnd, oh yeah, did you know Dr. Judd must be a hell of a man to take the abuse he gets each month? My hat’s off to you, Dr. Judd.\nLouie Simmons",

This is impossible to do without see- ing these people in the gym and observing their form. Their form may be terrible, or they may have a blatant muscle weakness that is causing bad form. For all those people, here is a sample workout to prepare you for a meet. This is the workout that Shawn Nutter used for his first meet. His lifts at 242 were an 840 squat, a 575 bench, and a 650 deadlift. At his first meet, he totaled 2065.We based his attempts on a max band squat of 565 bar weight plus 375 pounds of band tension. The bands were attached to the base of our monolift, which had a 2 x 4 taped to each side.Although we don’t truly cycle yearly for a meet, the circa-max, or near-max, phase lasts 3 weeks, plus there are two deload phase weeks. To begin with, Shawn used a 3-week wave with a Safety Squat bar. Through- out the year we use the Safety Squat bar and our 14-inch-cambered bar to save the shoulders and arms.Here is Shawn’s training for the IPA Nationals.\nFirst wave with the Safety Squat bar:\nWeek 1: 8 sets of 2 reps with 325 plus light bands Week 2: 8 sets of 2 reps with 375 plus light bands Week 3: 6 sets of 2 reps with 415 plus light bands Week 4: 8 sets of 2 reps with 325 plus medium bands Week 5: 8 sets of 2 reps with 375 plus medium bands Week 6: 6 sets of 2 reps with 415 plus medium bands\nSwitch to a 14-inch-cambered bar:\nWeek 7: 8 sets of 2 reps with 405 plus strong bands Week 8: 8 sets of 2 reps with 465 plus strong bands Week 9: 6 sets of 2 reps with 505 plus strong bands\nCirca-max phase:\nWeek 10: 5 sets of 2 reps with 435 plus medium and strong bands Week 11: 4 sets of 2 reps with 465 plus medium and strong bandsWeek 12: work up to 565 with medium and strong bands, about 350 pounds of band tension at the topWeek 13 (first deload week): work up to 565 with one strong band for 1 repWeek 14 (second deload week): work up to 405 plus 120 pounds of chain for 3 sets of 2 repsWeek 15 (mmet): 2005 IPA Nationals\nI knew the training should have rendered an 860 squat at he meet. He blew up 840 like a toy. We like to leave some on the platform and make substantial progress at the next meet.Let’s look at Shawn’s special exercises after the squat workout. After Friday’s squat workout, Shawn first does speed pulls: 335 plus 100 pounds of band tension at the start and 220 at lockout, 5-8 singles, each week. Next, he does 45 degree hypers, 3-5 sets with 45-135 pounds, 2-6 reps. Then he does calf/ham/glute raises with a 45-pound plate, 4-6 sets of 3-6 reps. Next are abs of some kind, then hypers, 3 sets on the roller Reverse Hyper machine, 280 pounds for sets of 10 reps, and 3 sets on the strap Reverse Hyper machine, 380 pounds for sets of 10’s. After some light stretching, he’s done.Monday is max effort for the squat and deadlift. Here is Shawn’s 15-week cycle. Yours can vary.\nWeek 1: raise GPP with sled pulls, 180 pounds for 6 trips of 200 feet as a warmup; 10-inch low-box squat with the Safety Squat bar for max singles; good mornings on the Back Attack machine; 45-degree hypers, 4 sets of 6 reps with 90 pounds; chest-supported rows; 5 sets on the Reverse Hyper (RH) machine; abs.Week 2: rack pulls with plates 6 inches off the floor; chest- supported rows; RH, 3 sets; roller RH, 3 sets; strap RH; abs.Week 3: sled pulls, 360 pounds, 4 trips of 200 feet for a warmup; cambered-bar good mornings to a max triple; straight-leg deadlifts, work up to 455 for 5 reps; barbell rows; lat pull-downs with V-bar; strap RH; abs.Week 4: reverse band box squats with monster mini-bands (reduces weight on the box by 120 pounds; made 775); good mornings on the Back Attack machine; dumbbell rows; kettle-bell swings; calf/ham/glute raises holding a 45-pound plate; abs.Week 5: sled pulls, 135 for 8 trips of 200 feet; concentric Safety Squat bar squats done to a max single; 45-degree RH, 180 for 3 sets of 2 reps; chest-supported rows; roller RH, 3 light sets; strap RH, 3 light sets; abs.Week 6: close-stance sumo standing on a 2-inch box for a max single; front squats on a 10-inch box for 6-8 reps with moderate weight; calf/ham/glute raises for sets of 6 reps; barbell rows; strap RH, 4 sets; abs.Week 7: sled pulls, 8 trips of 100 feet; lat pull-downs, wide bar and V-handle; band leg curls; band good mornings; RH; abs.Week 8: band deadlifts, 370 pounds of tension at the top, max single (he made 405 on the bar with 370 pounds of band tension); chest- supported rows; calf/ham/glute raises, 3 sets of 4 reps, 90 pounds; strap RH, 3 sets; abs.Week 9: light sled pulls, 135 for 8 sets of 2 reps; light lat pull-downs; roller RH, 3 light sets; abs. This workout is very easy because the following Friday the circa-max phase starts.Also during the next 3 weeks, our max effort is changed from maxing out on a barbell lift to pushing the special exercises to high limits. Don’t push the low back and lats plus abs together. Rather, we train one muscle group very hard and the others moderately hard.Week 10: light good mornings, work up to 70% for 3 reps, 1 set; moderate chest-supported rows; 3 sets of 3 reps of calf/ham/glute raises, as heavy as possible; heavy RH, 3 sets of 10 reps; roller RH with 360 pounds, 3 sets of 10 reps; strap RH with 480 pounds; abs.Week 11: sled pulls, 225 pounds for 6 trips of 200 feet; barbell rows, 135 for 4 sets of 6 reps; heavy RH, both styles, weight the same as week 10; abs.Week 12: Because we take a max on Friday with lots of band tension, no barbell exercises are done; chest-supported rows; calf/ham/glute raises, 3 sets with light weight; 45-degree RH, 200 pounds, 3 sets of 2 reps; light roller RH, 180 pounds, 3 sets of 10 reps; abs.Week 13: Remember, this is a deload week; sled pulls, 90 pounds, 6 sets of 200 feet; light lat rows or pull-downs; moderate RH, 2 sets on roller model with 270 pounds, 10 reps, 2 sets on strap model, 360 pounds for 10 reps; abs.Week 14: This is the Monday of the meet. Do light RH and abs.\nNote: After both squat day and max effort day workouts, always stretch lightly and do some joint mobil- ity work. Most lifters at Westside never wear the straps up or knee wraps. This is up to you. All squats are done on boxes. You must taper down before meet days.\nGPP is very important if you want to reach the top. If you are unfit and can’t do the proper exercises or do sled pulling, tred mill work, or kettle bell work, you will undoubt- edly fail. I have seen men that did not believe in being physically fit have to quit because of poor health. These men are classified as “ronins”: samarais without a master. When they quit, they have no one to answer to, when they could have passed on their experience to others so they won’t make the same mistakes. At the meet, open up light, something around 90% of your contest best. Don’t let your ego beat you.\nIf you must, practice with your gear. Know your attempts and have good help with you. Don’t ask strangers to help; they don’t know you or your needs. Don’t look at the meet as your last, but rather build your total from meet to meet.\nAt Westside, we help each other. If one of our lifters asks someone outside our gym for help, we feel betrayed. You are either with us or against us.It may take a while to master the gear. There is a lot of good gear to choose from.\nDon’t mix and match systems. This won’t work. Powerlifting is a great sport; respect it.\nLouie Simmons",

However, I don’t have the time to do this. Westside makes training tapes on all matters of training, plus I write articles for `!Powerlifting USA`! almost monthly. This way we can reach a large audience. Besides not having the time to do personal workouts, if I can’t see you in person, I can’t tell your weaknesses, which could be a muscle group or bad form. It takes years to learn the powerlifts.\nAfter 13 years of training, I realized I knew very little about it, even after making top 10 lifts in all categories from 1972 to 2002. I was eighth in the bench press in 1980 without a bench shirt, so I know how to raise a raw bench. I was sixth in 2002 with a bench shirt, but very weak. Shortly after that, I received a new shoulder socket, bicep surgery, and a second shoulder operation.\nI started to understand bench press training in 1993 after 23 years of continuous training. Back then, Westside had three 600-pound benchers, all juniors. Now after 25 years, I am beginning to understand more fully how to bench. As of 2005, Westside has produced 16 700+ benchers and one 800+ bencher, in addition to 25 650+ benchers, with the lightest being Jason Fry, who did 650 at 180 pounds.\nThe following is a 6-week general program that Westside follows. Incidentally, all the men I write about train at Westside. Anyone is welcome to visit. Just set up a date, as we are not open to the public. Speed work, or the dynamic method, will develop a fast rate of force. Maximal strength comes from special exercises. On Saturday or Sunday do speed work. After a good warm-up, do 9 sets of 3 reps. John Stafford’s bench is 733 at 275. His weight on the bar is 205-225. This is 45% of his 1-rep max on floor press. This formula works for everyone. The grips are 3 sets with the index finger touching the smooth part of the bar, 3 sets with the thumbs extending from the edge of the smooth part of the bar, and 3 sets with the little fingers on the power ring. You must use mini-bands or 2 or 3 sets of chains, Westside style. This simple method will build all major muscle groups. Press the bar in a straight line, not over the face.\nThis is the safest way to bench, and remember, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Lower the bar as fast as possible to create a strong stretch reflex for reversal strength. Your speed with your worse grip should be at least 0.7 meters/second. After benching, choose a bar triceps exercise–J.M. press, straight-bar triceps extensions, or football bar extensions–3-6 reps per set, working up as heavy as possible on that particular day. Then choose a second tri ceps exercise with dumbbells, e.g., extensions with elbows out to the sides or roll-backs with palms facing, working up in weight, or choose a weight and do multiple sets. Dumbbell reps are in the 6-12 range, 40-70 total reps. The triceps are the prime bench press mover. They must fire first. To do that, they have to be the strongest muscle group. At the first sign of staleness, change the barbell or dumbbell exercise or both, so progress can continue throughout the year.\nNext, do lat work. Again, choose one or two exercises: barbell or dumbbell rows, chest-supported rows, lat pull-downs, etc. Your lats help place the bar on the chest, by helping you to lower the bar. Reps and sets, as for all exercises, are based on your level of preparedness. Last, work the side and rear delts, upper back, and biceps with hammer curls. Do prehab work for pecs and rotators. On max effort day, work up to a max single. It may not be an all-time record, but it must be a current max. Doing sets of 2 or 3 reps with weights above 90% is known as the method of heavy efforts. Please remember, the volume is high, but the intensity can be higher. If you train at 85, 90, or 95%, you are re ally only using 85, 90, or 95% of your muscle potential, not 100%. Your technique must be built by singles. Limit the top lifts, after a good warm-up, to 3. The first weight should be at 90% or so, the second near a record or just above, then possibly one more single.\nFor example, for a floor press record of 500 pounds, the first attempt might be 450, the second, 490, and the last, 505. This workout should occur on Wednesday. This allows 10 days off heavy weights before meet time. This also is 72 hours from the last extreme bench workout. I will now outline a 6-week program. The sequence can change to fit your preference, and you can add or replace the core exercises in this program. Workout 1. Do floor press with 200 pounds of chain draped over the sleeve. Next, add weight to the bar until a max on that day results. George Halbert’s best is 445 with 200 pounds of chain. This is how George works up to his best.\n135 plus chains for 5 reps 225 plus chains for 3 reps 275 plus chains for 3 reps 315 plus chains for 1 rep 365 plus chains for 1 rep 405 plus chains for 1 rep\nTry a new max or the most on this day. Then, as on speed day, do triceps, lats, upper back, and rear and side delts. A 300-350 pound raw bencher should use 3 sets of chains. A 350- 450 pound bencher should use 4 sets of chains. Although anyone can use any amount of chain to set a record. If you use two different grips with all three chain weights, you have five workouts to choose from. Workout 2. Do overhead band press, or the lightened method, by attaching a Jump-Stretch band at the top of a power rack. You can reduce the weight at your chest by 155 with a strong set of bands. A medium set will reduce the weight at your chest by 95 pounds. A light set will reduce the weight by 65 pounds.\nAfter warming up, work up to a max single. My personal records were 580 with strong bands and 520 with medium bands. This was right on with the 60-pound difference between the band strengths. Amy Weisburger has a 370 bench and mostly uses the medium and light bands. This is very close to duplicating the value of a bench shirt without using one. Get a PR with a close grip and a wide grip with three different band strengths and two different grips. This represents five completely different workouts. Always follow with triceps, lats, upper back, and rear and side delts.\nWorkout 3. Do football bar presses. This bar allows the palms to be facing each other. We work up to a new PR for 3 reps or a 1-rep max. The bar has different width grips to choose from: close, medium, and wide. We use it by itself or with mini-bands, light bands, or a set(s) of chains. During the workout, at least two grips are used. This bar works the triceps hard. Then flat, incline, or decline presses are done. The J.M. press is performed at times, also duplicating the groove of a bench press shirt. It is very effective, although it hits the triceps very hard. You must again work extensions with dumbbells, with the elbows in or the roll-back variety. Then do lat work. Always rotate exercises that work the same muscle groups, but in a slightly different way. Last, do upper back, rear and side delts, and hammer curls. Again, look at the possibilities: two different band tensions, three chain weights, and three grips to choose adds up to eight different workout PR’s to break. Workout 4. Do illegally wide benching. Take a grip outside the power ring, wider than allowed at a con test. Work up to a max 6 reps. I got this from Bill Seno, a great bencher and bodybuilder from the 1960s through early 1980s. You can also work up to an 8-rep max and even a 10-rep max. This was Bill’s inten tion for me, but I didn’t like 8 or 10 reps. It simply took too much energy.\nSorry, Bill. But those wide 6’s gave me a top 10 bench in 1980. If you never trained for a raw bench, you would never know how to get one. I’m sure Scott Mendelson will have good tips for a raw bench. On the day after benching, do dumbbells on an incline or decline for several sets. This is primarily a hypertrophy day. Most dumbbell presses are done with palms facing each other. A few sets can be done with the thumbs facing each other because that simulates taking the bar out of the rack. As always, do triceps first, then lats, upper back, and rear and side delts. Note: We don’t work front delts directly too often due to overtraining. I observed that the guys who do a lot of front delts are not our best bench ers. As you can see, max effort day can be replaced with a repetition day to increase muscle mass. No one method will work; you must use all proven methods. Workout 5. Do band presses by attaching bands to the bottom of your rack. You can build a fast start and a strong lockout. A mini- band attached to the bottom of our power rack (see the Bench Workout DVD) will add 40 pounds at the chest and 85 pounds at the lockout.\nA monster mini-band will add 50 pounds at the chest and 110 at lockout. A light band doubled up at the bottom will add 100 pounds at the chest and 200 at the top. Halbert, Wolf, and Winters, guys who bench over 600 raw, use medium and strong bands and even mul tiple bands. Work up to a single. Full range is mostly used, but sometimes we press off power rack pins or boards. Your band tension may vary depending on how you hook up the bands. Use two grips: a wide grip and also a close grip. This will result in two PR’s. Don’t forget to do triceps, lats, and so forth. Workout 6. Do board presses. I did board presses in 1970. The Culver City Westside guys were doing them at that time. I got very little out of them. Why? I had weak triceps. Larry Pacifico said I had to work my triceps if I ever was to bench big. He was right. In 1993, Jesse Kellum said I should use them again. Now we were training our triceps very hard. After our success, everyone is doing board presses and everyone’s an expert.\nHere’s the truth about board press. They are not a tricep builder if you start the lift with your pecs. Many do just that. Start the motion with the arms. I watch a lot of people do board presses thinking that they will build a strong lockout. I saw people do board presses with bench shirts continuously, and two of them lost their lock out at the meet by 60 pounds. The others were not top 10 benchers anyway. Remember, the bench is a full-range motion. Maybe this is why so many dump the bar on their belly, not practicing full-range motion. The workout is simple. After a warmup, work up to a max single. One, two, or three boards are used at Westside. Four and five boards are for isolating the triceps. There are exercises that build strength and those that test strength. Board presses test strength. Have you ever watched point karate? They always stop the punch just short of the face. Well, I believe the board press does the same thing. I hear what so and so did off a board press, only to go to the meet and be un able to touch their chest. I think his name was Curly or Moe. Or maybe it was Larry. But who cares?\nWhat a stooge! These workouts give you a wide variety to choose from. Mix and match any way you want. See you at he meet.\nLouie Simmons",

It was an effective method to develop strength at a particular angle and affordable to most because of the limited amount of equipment needed.\nThe famous Bob Hoffman of York Barbell fame manufactured an isometric power rack in the 1960s. T Hettinger and E. Mueller found that a small workout daily for 10 weeks would increase strength about 5% per week, which was maintained for a month.\nThere has always been the question, which is more productive, dynamic or isometric exer- cises? In my opinion, both must be trained. There are always pros and cons for any type of training. Here are the benefits:\n* Isometrics take less time and energy to perform a workout.\n* You can maintain speed strength while doing isometric training.\n* For those wanting to remain in a particular weight class, isometrics won’t add muscle mass.\n* They fortify technique in crucial positions. A coach can watch to see form breaks at many differ- ent angles of the lift.\n* Maximal effort can be displayed longer than with dynamic work.\nWhen doing dynamic work, maximal effort is displayed for a fraction of a second at the mini-max, or sticking point. While doing speed deadlifts, all looks well. The bar is blasted from the floor to lockout. However, with a max effort deadlift, the bar stops at the knee or just before lockout. Hardly any work is done at the mini-max. It’s just too fast. A 3-second isometric hold can be equal to many dynamic contractions.\n* The work at a particular angle is radiated 15% either above or below the point where the force is applied.\n* It sounds contradictory, but holding your breath can boost endurance. Remember, a swimmer inhales only once every 3 or 4 strokes.\nThe following points are disadvantages of isometrics.\n* Isometrics are not to be used before puberty or if one is a novice.\n* Isometrics can fatigue the central nervous system.\n* If done alone, a loss of some coordination will occur.\n* Holding your breath for a long time can have a negative effect on the cardiovascular system.\nHow are isometrics performed? Here is how Westside does them. The simplest way is to push or pullagainst a pin, which can be placed at different positions. For example, if you are weak at the floor, pull on a fixed bar at that position, or just below the knee, at the knee, and possibly at the lockout.\nLike all isometric contractions, you can use submaximal or maximal efforts while exerting on the bar. Also, the duration that you push or pull on the bar can vary from 2 to 6 seconds per exertion.\nQuasi-isometrics is pushing or pulling slowly, over a certain range of motion. This can be done by attaching a series of Jump-Stretch bands to the bar. For example, loop a series of bands over a bar placed on the floor. Now it is possible to lift the bar very slowly through a predetermined range of motion. Adjust the bands to work that part of the lift that needs to be improved.\nDynamic isometrics is pulling or pushing a bar against a fixed pin as fast as possible with a brief contraction. Because of the short contraction, it is possible to do several efforts. However, it is essential to perform the movement as fast as possible to produce a steep force/time curve, like slow- er isometrics, where the contractions are sometimes 3-6 seconds per effort. The dynamic effort can be limited to 1 second per effort. Three efforts of 1 second can replace a 3-second effort if done dynamically.\nDo 3-5 positions for static work, with the work radiating 15 degrees above and below the point being pushed or pulled upon. This will satisfy the entire range of motion. Although isometrics are found to develop absolute strength, as you can see, they also increase dynamic strength. Verk- hoshansky found that the time one holds a position isometrically is as important as the intensity of the hold.\nI have always prefered the Hoffman method. For example, lift 400 pounds upward a predeter- mined distance into a fixed pin. Hold for 3-6 seconds. A weight of 400 would be 75% of a 600-pound max. It is very hard to calculate how much you are truly exerting against a chosen pin. For absolute strength, hold maximal tension. For explosive strength, use maximal speed and exert 70-80% against the pin. The faster you get to 70-80%, the better.\nIsometrics are very effective but also very taxing. The faster the lift is performed, the less time the mini-max is worked. All training methods must be used during training. It is up to the coach to know when to utilize a particular training method.\nFor a more detailed explanation of the above, see Verkhoshansky (1970), or The Fundamen- tals of Special Strength-Training in Sport.\nRemember, the faster the rate of force development against the pin, the better. The longer the exertion against the bar, the greater the results, even with different intensities. Don’t exceed 10 min- utes of isometric work per workout. Like any training, rotate isometrics throughout the year. For ex- plosive strength, one must produce maximum speed as fast as possible against the pin. The simplest form of isometrics is just tensing the muscles, as in a bodybuilding pose. This was advocated by Vorobyev in 1978 and as early as the 1900s by Anokhin and Proshek, by forcefully tensing the agonists and antagonists for every joint.\nI hope just some small part of this article will awaken your mind to try a new method of training.\nLouie Simmons",

We do them to produce world-record squats. The late, great Matt Dimel made 1010 in 1985 at SHW. Chuck Vogelpohl pushed the limit of the squat by doing 1025 at 220 pounds, the lightest man to do a grand. I am sure that the original Westside Barbell in Culver City, California, was asked the same questions in the 1960s and early 1970s, when Bill West and George Frenn were breaking squats records beyond comprehension. Frenn made 854 in gym trunks at 242 and held a world record in the weight throw. Later men such as Larry Kidney and his training partners Marve Phillips broke many world record squats by box squatting. Paul Childress has made 1123 at 308, and I am sure Paul has to defend why he box squats.\nMy friend Eskil, from Sweden, found a training manual from the 1950s at a Polish weight lifting facility demonstrating the box squat. Today, my friend Sakari, from Finland, teaches box squatting to their strongest lifters. Lifters from Ireland, Germany, England, Canada, and Sweden are also box squatting. At Westside, in Columbus, Ohio, we have five men who squat more than 1000 pounds and a woman, Amy Weisburger, who at 148 has squatted 565. Because I am asked why do box squats, I will explain simply and scientifically why we do them and why you should too. First, there is only one way to box squat. `! Pure Power`! had an article on ways to box squat, but there is only one proven way: the Westside way. Here’s how. First, push the glutes rearward as far as possible. With a tight back arch to descend to the box. Push your neck into your traps. Push your knees apart to maximally activate the hips. When sitting on the box, the shins should be straight up and down or even past perpendicular. This places all the work on the hamstrings, glutes, hips, and low back. These are the precise muscle groups that do a very large percent of the squat. After sitting completely on the box, some glute and hip muscles are relaxed somewhat. Then forcefully flex the abs, hips, and glutes and jump off the box. To ascend correctly, push the traps into the bar first. This will flex the back muscles, then the hips and glutes, and finally the legs. If you push with the legs first, you will be in a good morning position because the glutes will raise first, causing you to bend over.\nRemember that where the head goes, the body will follow. Note: Always push the feet out to the sides, not directly down. Chuck Taylors are the best shoes for squatting. This was tested at Ball State University in lab conditions. Box squats have tremendous advantages over regular squats. These are as follows. You do not get as sore from a box squat workout, and you can recover much faster. If the box that you are squatting on is below parallel and you do a thousand squats, they will all be below parallel, regardless of the weight. This is important because when many lifters warm up, they cannot break parallel with light weight, or as the weight nears a max, many will cut depth. However, with a box to sit on, you will always break parallel, or any depth desired. Box squats can increase flexibility. When monitoring flexibility, you should be able to break parallel with your competition stance. If this is not possible, sit on a box about 2 inches above parallel.\nAfter mastering that height, reduce the box height by half an inch. The easiest way is to remove a 1/2 inch rubber mat. Then sit on the box at that new height until comfortable. Reduce the height half an inch again. Continue this until you are not only at parallel but below. Start with a shoulder-width stance. Then widen your stance by an inch or two each time until a very wide stance is achieved. John Stafford has sat on a 6 inch box; he is 6 feet tall, 285 pounds. I am always concerned when a coach asks how low can we squat, referring to Olympic squats. A very close squat stance makes no sense. Look at a pyramid; the wider the base, the greater the pyramid. I guess if my only claim to fame was bouncing my ass off my heels with 315, I would ask that question myself. Box squatting with a slow count is a form of PNF (propriceptive neuromuscular facilitation), commonly used in clinical settings. This type of stretch involves a maximum precontraction of the muscle groups to undergo elongation.\nAs the box is lowered to an extreme for your range of motion, a box squat can become a safe ballistic stretch method. This will not only increase your range of motion in the muscle groups but also increase joint mobility. Box squats also resemble CRAC (contract relax agonist contract), a form of stretching. This information can be found in `! Strength and Power in Sport`! (1991). If you lower to the box slowly and widen your stance slowly, more muscle flexibility and joint mobility can be achieved. A lighter weight can achieve a bigger squat with box squatting. By training at 50-60% of your 1-rep max in a 3-week wave, a large squat can be developed.\nThree lifters trained with 405-480 for 8-10 doubles with 120 pounds of chain as a reactive method. They all made their first 800+ squat. Jumping ability is developed with box squats. John Stafford, at 290 body weight, can jump onto a 35 inch box with a pair of 35 pound dumbbells. John Harper, a sophomore at Kent State University, is a discus thrower (with 189 feet) who can jump onto a 50 inch box. Maybe more extraordinary is that he is able to sit on his knees and jump onto his feet with 255 pounds on his back, due largely to box squatting. Box squatting increases pulling power. It closely simulates the motion of pulling off the floor, first by relaxing on the box after lowering onto it, then exploding upward. This is very close to the movement known as the modified dive.\nIf one suffers a knee injury, box squatting can be done while rehabing the injury. When sitting on a box fully and correctly, the shins are past perpendicular. This reduces the pressure on the patella tendons by placing the majority of the weight on the hamstrings and glutes and on the heels, not the toes. It should be noted that the box itself reduces a portion of the bar weight or body weight that you are trying to move. After a complete patella tendon rupture, box squats helped me to go from an 821 squat in 1991 to a 920 at 235 body weight in 2002 after the injury. John Bott had similar success. Also, I mustn’t forget Jim Hoskinson, who had a horrendous injury to both knees. He had a 744 squat before the injury and had recently done 1091 in the same weight class, 308.\nA box squat combines two very important methods. One is the static-dynamic method. It combines two muscle activities. Static work occurs while on the box, although the lifter is constantly moving backward or forward. Then by flexing off the box, the dynamic sequence occurs. The second method that is used when box squatting is the relaxed- overcome-by-dynamic work. This occurs by sitting on the box with the hips rolling in a relaxed fashion, then switching to an explosive, or dynamic, concentric phase. Both of the above-mentioned methods build explosive strength as well as absolute strength. Why are box squats superior to conventional squats? I hope to explain it further through physics. Lowering to the box in the eccentric phase is a form of potential energy. When sitting on the box in about 0.5 second, you are involved in a collision. By using a box to land on, we can produce kinetic energy. The amount of kinetic energy an object has depends on two things: its mass (weight) and its speed. A heavier weight means more kinetic energy. But more importantly, in a regular squat, the eccentric phase lasts about 1 second, about twice as long as in a box squat. By being able to relax some muscles and with the use of Jump- Stretch bands, the box squat is close to twice as fast. If you tripled the speed, it would represent 9 times more kinetic energy during the collision.\nWhat about the development of power? Power is defined as work done divided by the time used to do the work. When you do a regular squat, you must do three things. The first is the eccentric phase, where muscles lengthen. When the eccentric phase stops, a static phase begins, where the muscles are not lengthening or shortening, but muscle energy is decreasing. Then to raise concentrically, you must start a load while the muscles are held statically, even to a brief extent. Could this phenomenon be the reason that you can lower 50% more than you can raise? After all, power can be produced only so long. In a regular squat, you must produce power during all three phases, but a box squat breaks up the eccentric and concentric phases because some of the muscles are relaxing while others are held statically by movement in the hip joints. Here is where force can be redirected very strongly. Because a heavy squat uses a large amount of energy, it makes sense to break the work into separate parts. While box squatting is not plyometrics, it builds tremendous reversal strength. Wilson’s studies (1990) have shown that the stretch reflex lasts up to 2 seconds. We have proven that by sitting on a box correctly the reflex lasts up to 8 seconds. What an advantage for a football lineman on a long count. Explosive strength is developed mainly by explosive efforts, such as jumps, shot put, and jerking dumbbells or a barbell.\nHowever, it is easiest and safest to develop explosive strength by increasing maximal strength (`! Science of Sports Training`!, Thomas Kurz). I hope this convinces you to try box squatting, which many of the old champs and the new champs are doing.\nLouie Simmons",

For such a simple lift, the deadlift can be complicated to train. If one only deadlifts, progress will stall or injuries are certain. No one is totally built to deadlift. The lower back can be overtrained if one bends over too much, or it can be undertrained if the legs are used too much. If sumo deadlifts are done constantly, the back will become weak while the hips will be overused. My friend Sakari, from Finland, has surveyed the top 15 deadlifters in Finland and discovered that more than 60% of the deadlift training for sumo pullers is special exercises. At Westside we have found the same. Let’s look at some of those exercises.\nThere are many styles of good mornings to choose from. Matt Smith does mostly concentric good mornings. He fixes a set of chains hanging from the power rack, with the loop of the chain 3 feet off the floor. He suspends the bar in the chains. He ducks under the bar and muscles up the weight. Once your style is developed, continue to use that style, and as the weight goes up, so does your squat and deadlift. Matt’s best is 860 pounds. A final note: don’t swing the weight. If you do, you may start the load with the bar behind the knees. This is a squat, not a good morning. Remember, the bar must be in front of the knees to be a good morning. The concentric good morning builds little muscle mass.\nThe most common good morning at Westside is the bent-over style with a 14-inch-cambered bar. First stand up with bar. Sink the chest to round the back slightly. Fill the abs with air and bend over with the glutes pushed out to the rear as far as possible. When going from the eccentric phase to the concentric phase, try to arch the back as you complete the lift. Don’t go too low: On EMG testing, the spinal erectors will shut off and the low lumbars will be activated. This is dangerous. The next type of good morning is the arched-back style. This is my favorite. I like the Safety Squat bar for this exercise. I don’t wear gear or a belt. Push the glutes to the rear as far as possible. Very little leg bend is used. Overarch the back. In the bottom, pause for a split second, push your head into the pad by picking up your chin, and come up. When I break my arched-back good morning record, I break my squat record. The camber of the Safety Squat bar places the center line of the bar well in front of the knees. Chuck Vogelpohl and many others do a combo squat/good morning. Just bend over into a good morning, then drop into a parallel squat and return to the starting position. This can be done with or without a box. Try to keep the reps to lower than 3 and no more than 6. Whether you wear a belt and/or suit with the straps down is up to you and your ability. We use many special bars for squats as well as good mornings. We also sometimes raise the heels by 2 inches; this puts extra work on the lower back. Raising the toes 1-2 inches puts pressure on the hamstrings. The legendary Paul Anderson was doing all the varieties of the good mornings I have talked about. A training partner of Paul Childress let me in on a little secret to building some very strong erectors. Place one foot on a 2 x 6 board. Do 3-5 reps in either the bent-over or arched-back good morning. This will really isolate the spinal erectors and hamstrings.\nIf it sounds like Westsiders do a lot of good mornings, we do. For other sports teams, try doing walking bent-over lunges with a Safety Squat bar. I’ve had NFL football players, top soccer players from the U.K., professional rugby coaches from the U.K., and MMA fighters do this, and it kicked their asses in a good way. Very low box squats are also used to build a deadlift by building a strong lower back and hips by isolating these crucial muscle groups. Some men who are very flexible will squat off a 6-inch box, although most use a 10-inch box. Reps of 1-5 works best. A strong squatter will do 60-70% of their contest squat. Use groove briefs or a suit with the straps down. Don’t forget to use as many different bars as possible to break records. After doing a max effort workout with a special squat or good morning or even a box, rack, or regular deadlift, there are very specialized exercises that must be done. The following describes some of them. In the 45-degree back raise, work up to a hard set of 3-5 reps. A decent goal would be 200 pounds for 5 reps. Lock the low back statically and squeeze the glutes as hard as possible.\nWe use our own C/H/G design, with a 3-foot-wide pad. After all, a wider base is best. If your base is narrower than the top, it is unstable, and so is any coach who preaches this style. Pull-throughs are very productive. They can be done with a Jump- Stretch band or a low-pulley machine. Do high reps, 10-15. When doing heavy weight on a low pulley, it is hard to keep your balance because the weight on the cable may exceed your body weight. Another way to do pull-throughs, the riginal way, is with a kettle bell. Use a shoulder-width stance. Place both hands on the kettle bell. Swing it through the legs until the hamstrings and glutes stop the bell. This sets the stretch reflex into action. Very quickly, swing to the front, to waist height or higher, and repeat for 6-12 reps depending on the weight. Do 3 or 4 sets. These can be done with one arm, two arms, or alternating hands. Try some one-arm deadlifts. Sumo style works best. Use straps or a hook grip. They work muscles you didn’t know you had. Reps work best, 3-5. Herman Gonner has done 727 pounds.\nZercher lifts will build every squat and deadlift muscle in your body, with the exception of your hands. Westside does a lot of grip work with various devices, such as the Rolling Thunder from Ironmind, the G-Rex Grip from Sorinex, and the Telegraph Key, and by holding the bell end of a hex dumbbell. Pay attention to stretching and joint mobility work. Ab work is also essential. I prefer the stand-up style. Kettle bell swings work the abs well. Some Westsiders do weighted sit-ups, flat or decline. We also use a device of Pat Roberts that has helped a lot. It’s a wheel with metal foot straps with which you walk on your hands or do push-ups. We also do a lot of static holds with the wheel. It not only builds the abs, but it works the upper and lower back.\nAn added plus for me is that it works my groin and legs. One other very important machine, the Reverse Hyper machine, will not only build the hamstrings, glutes, and spinal erectors but also traction the low back by rotating the sacrum and rehydrating the disks. (The Reverse Hyper machine has two U.S. patents, a third patent pending, and a U.S. trademark.) This machine is used at least four times a week. On a strap Pro model, Chuck’s normal weight is 480-520 for 3 sets of 10 reps. On the same day, Chuck will also do 3 sets on a roller Pro model. The usual weight is 360 for 10 reps. This workout is done Monday and Friday. On bench days, he performs 2 sets of 15 reps on just one machine with about 70% of the weight of the heavy day.\nAlso a lot of leg curls are done with the roller Pro model. Always rotate a core exercise each week. A good morning, a low box squat, a rack pull, etc., can be rotated. Switch the special exercises as often as necessary. One exercise may make the difference between failure and success. So pick wisely: not the ones you like, but the ones that work. P.S. Congratulations to Nick Winters, who became Westside’s 16th 700- pound bencher on September 10.\nLouie Simmons",

They were very effective but were overused, without mixing other types of resistance. Plyometrics are overused and misunderstood in most cases. They should be just a small part of training for explosive strength. Most kids jump rope, a simple form of plyos. Yes, it is very important to develop power quickly, but it is also important to maintain power for sports such as football, wrestling, and some running events. All ball players run fast and slow and have quick changes in direction. This is very taxing on the central nervous system. If one wants to become more explosive, he or she must raise maximum strength.\nAt Westside it is common to see Chester Stafford jump onto a 35 inch box with a pair of 70 pound dumbbells at a bodyweight of 290, or to see Andre Henry, at 460, jump onto a 20 inch box with a 160 pound weight vest on. Neither man had a previous plyometric background. How did they do it? Many strength coaches call me about power and speed training, but very few ask about building absolute strength. If your reactive strength grows, your jumping and running ability will increase. That is why men can outperform women in the 100 meter, shot put, basketball, football, and lifting weights. Most coaches are constantly working on speed and quickness, but that’s the trait they recruited.\nWhy constantly work on what they already have? Most stay away from heavy weight training for fear of overtaxing their athletes. However, when running full speed, 4, 5, and sometimes 6 times bodyweight is produced during foot contact, while a 300 pound lineman is lucky to squat twice his bodyweight. Relative strength is much lower for large men compared with smaller, lighter men. Phil Harrington, the world record holder in the squat at 900 at a bodyweight of 181, can also jump onto a 50 inch box. As his squat increased, so did his box jump. When Jud Logan, the Olympic hammer thrower, failed to increase, he employed box jumps to push his throws to new lengths. He had a 440 powerclean and a back squat of about 770 pounds. His box jump was an incredible 55 inches at 285 bodyweight. Jud, like Westsiders, was already strong, and used box jumps for quickness to increase his throws, just like Westside uses the jumps to increase our squat and deadlift. What about lifters and other athletes who aren’t very strong? How can they increase their explosive power?\nBy using the reactive method. Here’s how. One reacive method exercise is weight releasers. Here, extra weight is added to the bar on the eccentric phase by the use of weight releasers. It is common to lower 80% of your 1-rep max and raise 60%. This is done by putting 20% of the load on the weight releasers. As they release the load, the body reacts to the sudden reduction of weight, then accelerates concentrically to completion. The lifter reacts as if the original 80% was on the bar. This develops maximum acceleration and reversal strength. The eccentric phase should be as fast as possible, preferably five- to six-tenths of a second. Lowering slowly will build only muscle size and causes most muscular soreness. The squats are done for 2 reps, 6-10 sets. This method is frequently used by Matt Smith (2600 at SHW) and John Stafford (2437 at 275). Basically the same method is used for bench pressing. We do 6-10 sets of 3 reps. Of course only the first rep is a contrast rep, as the weight releaser device falls off. This is good because eccentric work causes the most muscle soreness due to muscle spindle damage.\nA second method for contrasting a load is the lightened method. At Westside a strong pair of Jump-Stretch bands are attached to our 7-foot power rack at the top. In the bottom of a squat, 135 pounds weighs zero. By adding 90 pounds to the bar, it now weighs 90 pounds at the bottom, but 225 at the top. By adding a second set of 45 pounds, the weight at the top is 315 pounds and 180 at the bottom. Your brain quickly learns that the load, while very light in the bottom, becomes quite heavy at the top. This teaches one to accelerate maximally to completion. This conditions one not to decelerate near completion, which occurs with just barbell weight. This system was first used in youth training overseas. If one could squat only 90 pounds, the load would seem light in the bottom after starting at the top with 225. Unlike the weight releaser system, the total load is reloaded as one stands. An extreme setup would look like this: Fix the bands so that there is 250 pounds less at the bottom of a squat. Load the bar to 1000 pounds. Set up with the 1000 pounds. The weight becomes lighter as one descends to the bottom until it is reduced to 750 pounds. The weight reduction is caused by the bands supporting part of the load. Then return to the top. As the weight is raised, the bands gradually reload to the original 1000 pounds.\nThis is a very effective reactive method. One becomes aquainted with a heavy load at the start of the squat while maximizing strength at the bottom and explosively returning to completion. Westside often uses this method for benching as well. While the deadlift does not require an eccentric phase in contests, we do deadlifts in a similar fashion. The bar is reduced by 135 pounds at the floor by supporting it with Jump-Stretch bands attached to the top of the power rack. After locking out the deadlift, the entire 135 pounds is lifted out of the bands. This method teaches an explosive start and to accelerate to the top. Let’s look at a slightly different method: the heavy-light method. The first system employs bands. For benching, on speed day, after a thorough warmup, use two sets of mini-bands with your prescribed amount of barbell weight. After doing 5 sets of triples, take off a set of mini-bands and do the remaining sets. The bar will feel extremely light. Fred Boldt’s sets look like this: 205 pounds bar weight plus two sets of mini-bands, equaling 170 pounds at the top and 80 pounds at the chest. After 4 sets of 3 reps with two sets of bands are done with a bar speed of about 0.75 meters/second, Fred takes off a set of mini- bands. Now the bar speed increases to 0.8 meters/second. Fred’s body reacts as if the original two sets of bands are still on the bar. The contrast between the heavy and light load causes added stimulus to the central nervous system, producing added acceleration.\nThis method can be used for squatting and deadlifting or even Olympic pulls. If you don’t have weight releasers or Jump-Stretch bands, the heavy-light method can be done by first using a weight of roughly 90% for 1 or 2 reps for 2 or 3 sets. Then reduce the bar weight to 40 to 60% and do 2 or 3 sets of 2 or 3 reps. This can be done on all lifts, in addition to weighted dips, weighted pull-ups, box jumps, etc. Keep reps low to conserve energy. A note to ball players: It’s great to be quick, but quickness is just one component of speed. Quickness is defined as an action of the body that does not require muscular effort or the complex coordination requiring energy (`!Soviet Training and Recovery Methods`!, Ben Tabachnik). I try to identify the authors I read, but I also identify the participants we test at Westside.\nWe test only the world’s best or nearly the world’s best. This authenticates my findings. Many experiments with novice lifters with poor form will yield insufficient data. There are many types of strength and many methods to develop them. Too much of one type of training can interfere with all the rest. So plan your training carefully and you will succeed more often than not. In the United States, the emphasis is on teaching, not coaching, so the coach must learn on the job. Don’t be afraid to experiment with new methods. Many of our new, so-called unproven methods are really old, proven Soviet methods, based on the coaches’ experience.\nLouie Simmons",

At Westside, a weekly plan is used on max effort day. Each week, the lifter switches a barbell exercise, always working up to a max single in a special squat or box, rack, or band deadlift. This is the maximal effort method. Only good mornings with an eccentric phase preceding a concentric phase are performed, for a 3-rep max.\nThis is the method of heavy efforts. Westside has proven the max effort method is superior. Why? A new plateau is reached. This is positive not only physically but also psychologically. The method of heavy efforts raises a problem of high volume, yet no new absolute records. A heavy effort means weights above 90% of a 1-rep max. Lifting weights at 90% or more for 3 weeks or longer will cause a negative effect on the central nervous system. To prevent this phenomenon, we switch the core lift each week. As one’s special physical preparedness increases, the training effect decreases. This is why new means of training must be introduced constantly, which is why we rotate exercises each week.\nThis is the conjugate system: using exercises that are similar to the classic exercise for either weight lifting or powerlifting. This provides unidirectional loading that highly stimulates motor potential and perfects technical skill. The same hold true for bench pressing. The floor press, board press, rack work, incline, decline, etc., are conjugate exercises. To clarify, max effort work is done once a week. For bench pressing, it is done 72 hours after speed-strength benching. At Westside speed bench is on Sunday and max bench is on Wednesday. Speed squat and deadlift are on Friday. Max effort work is on Monday. Extreme workouts can occur every 72 hours. Max effort work is a weekly plan, but must be considered into a yearly plan.\nSpeed strength work is done for a 3-week cycle. The weight with bands, chains, or both is changed each week, normally increasing each week for the 3 weeks. On the fourth week, the load is decreased or changed, and again another 3-week wave is started. Why do we start again after 3 weeks? We found that after 3 weeks, one cannot become faster or stronger. That is exactly why a 3-week wave is used. Dr. Mel Siff informed me that Vasily Alexeev used a similar wave system for his remarkable training. Remember, he was a weight lifter and used no gear. It worked because he physically got stronger. When squatting with different bars, each has a limit weight that has been obtained.\nFor example, I have done 805 with a regular squat bar on a parallel box, 640 with a Safety Squat bar, and 675 with a 14-inch cambered bar. I mention this because when using a 3-week wave with one particular bar, the same percentage will be a different amount of weight. For example: Squat bar: 50% = 402, 60% = 482 Safety Squat bar: 50% = 320, 60% = 384 Cambered bar: 50% = 337, 60% = 405 This must be closely governed. For myself, these numbers represent the weight equivalent to my max meet squat of 920. By changing bars each 3-week wave, a true max meet squat can be calculated. If one breaks a personal record on, let’s say, the cambered bar, a new meet record should be expected. The percents must be calculated off which bar one is using and the contrast method used (bands, chains, or both). If weight releasers are used, they also must be taken into consideration. Note: use weight releasers for only a 2-week wave. Eccentrics are responsible for most muscle soreness due to damaged muscle cells.\nSpeed pulls are done after speed squatting. For a 3-week wave, three weight changes, one each week, can be used. The second method would be to use three different band tensions, starting with light bands and working up to a stronger tension band for the next 2 weeks. If a contest is the goal, a reverse wave must be used. Simply start with the strongest tension and reduce band tension each week for 3 weeks. The top benchers I have talked to reduce bar weight or band weight as the meet approaches. This builds a greater rate of force development. This is part of the delayed transmutation phase, working with the maximal effort work. Remember, each week change bar speed by altering the amount of chain, band, or weight releasers, or a combination of all three.\nI have convered speed work and max effort work, but what about GPP? For squatting, John “Chester” Stafford rotates box squats with and without added weight, sled pulling for the upper or lower body, the Reverse Hyper machine, glute/ham raises, ab work, and band work. For band work, one or two extra workouts a week are done. The workouts are 20-30 minutes long. Band leg curls are done for about 60 reps in 2 or 3 sets. Next, good mornings (arched or rounded back), also for 2 or 3 sets, are done. Then pull-thoughs for 3 sets of 15 reps can be done. The combinations are endless. After 7-10 days start a different complex. Remember, the conjugate system is employed for speed work, max effort work, and extra workouts for strength development or GPP.\nDon’t forget about restoration methods. They must be included as well. Water therapy, massage, spinal adjustments, acupressure, and acupuncture can be constantly rotated throughout the year, divided into weekly and monthly plans. When people come to Westside, they witness training for an upcoming meet: the training just preceding a meet and the training months before a meet and how a particular type of training is utilized.\nSeventy percent of the world is covered by water. It is constantly moving in waves. Some are just ripples; others as large as tsunamis. Yet they somehow are coordinated together sometimes by the seasons. Just as our training is. It is truly very natural to train in waves if one just thinks about it in a systematic way.\nLouie Simmons",

Dan Wohleber pulls the first 900 pound deadlift.\nDave Waddington squats the first 1000 pound squat.\nMike McDonald does 512 pound bench press at 181 bwt. Remember no Shirts!\nWhile I am recovering from my back injuries, I found every book on training methodologies from the old Eastern Bloc I could. I was determined to outlast my rivals. There were many bright stars but the brightest stars seem to burn out fast.\nI found my new methods were working well. I decided to lift at 242 bwt just to get my 4th USPF Elite total. After that I found a meet in Toledo and decided to try for my fifth elite total at 275 bwt. The problem was that I could only weigh 234. Ten miles outside of Toledo I started drinking Gatorades. Chuck Vogelpohl kept handing me can after can, but still when I stepped on the scale I was 238. The official said you’re good, but I said I’m lifting 275 and so I stayed and drank Gatorades until I went over the 242 limit and officially made 275 class. I made my fifth elite exactly where I made my First elite.\nI squatted 800 pounds and benched 520, and did a 650 deadlift just to total that Fifth Elite. By the way all done with IPF or USPF judges.\nI was now wearing a bench shirt. They weren’t much, a bit better than nothing. Shirts came about in 1984 or early 1985. I have lifted in every era of powerlifting. Things change and so must lifters.\nI am one of a few to bench a top 10 bench 480, in 1980 without a shirt and 6th, 575 at 220 bwt in 2002 with a shirt at 54 yrs of age.\nEveryone would ask me about Anthony Clark’s benches, were they good? I always said yes. Now Gene Rychalk Jr. is the center of controversy. I saw Gene from the head judges chair do a perfect 1005 bench. Letter perfect. I’m sure if you throw some serious cash at Gene, he would shut the mouths of those who criticize him. My hat is off to Gene just like Jim Williams, Mike McDonald, Ted Arcidi, Ken Lane, and all the other great lifters thru out the decades.\nDon’t take powerlifting backwards; it could end up like US weightlifting whose road it travels is a dead end street. There are pretenders but they know who they are. You must respect each other. I recall in 1970, I was weighing in and George Crawford and Jerry Bell, the 1st 700 pound deadlifter at 165 bwt were escorting a little kid at meet, I ask who’s this? Jerry replied”this kid will be famous someday”; his name was Bob Wahl, 661 squat at 148 bwt in 1983. To this day I respect every lifter young or old that is brave enough to step on the platform.\nMy old friend Paul Sutphin, Mark Dimiduk, Jay Rosciglione, and many others of like Steve Wilson, John Black of Black’s Health World of Cleveland were all doing remarkable things.\nI lifted at the 1987 YMCA Nationals with 2033 at a light 242 and 4th place. Steve Goggins was already a superstar, just like today. My good friend Matt Dimel had squatted 1010 at SHW and was totaling 2300. It was a great loss to Westside when Matt died. Gary Sanger was moving to LSU to teach, Bill Whitaker was going to Pennsylvania to start a vet clinic, Dr Tom Paulucci had some medical problems and had to retire. Doug Heath was going strong. Bob Coe who showed up at my door 25 years ago is still at Westside. My knee had been hurting for some time about 5 years to be exact. I was going to the APF Nationals and was taking a low hassock record when 3⁄4 up, I snapped my left patella tendon in half. I had heard a few snap, but never thought I would hear my own. But it happened my kneecap was now on the inside of my leg. The emergency squad shows up in 10 minutes, they look at my leg and said we think you just dislocated your knee. I said no way jack. I am very allergic to anesthesia and so has a spinal block and I was awake during my surgery.\nAll went well, and 14 weeks later I go back with my friend Diane Black to have the wires removed. They gave me a shot to calm me for surgery. That shot put me to sleep and they proceeded to give me anesthesia. I stopped breathing for 4 minutes so they trached me and then inserted chest tubes when my lungs collapsed. I wake up 2 days later with holes in my chest and throat but no knee surgery! WOW that really helped! I didn’t know Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine and Dr. Howard was working on me. Well they inserted a air thru my nose and finished the job. After seven days in intensive care to do a four hour procedure, I was home.\nI was never going to compete again but Kenny Patterson said something to me that brought me out of retirement immediately. That was 1996 and powerlifting hadn’t gotten out of hand yet. I lifted 7 times in 11 months, and became the first 50 plus year old to bench 550, and the first to bench 600. This was in a closed back shirt. I made a top ten bench again. I hear people say I am not built to bench, squat or deadlift. If I made top ten lifting all categories, then almost anybody can. Except for you lazy bastards who have got some excuse why you can’t!\nPowerlifting comes in eras. No gear, some gear, better gear, and what I refer to as gangster gear. Legal thru loopholes. Get used to it. It is here to stay. It makes relative newcomers superstars fast. Big squats, big benches and most of the time a poor deadlift! This shows the true strength of a person.\nThe U.S.P.F. was kicked out of the I.P.F. I told Peter Thorne, we should pull out of the I.P.F. instead of being pushed out. Remember folks there are drug tested meets but no drug free meets. Get it straight because that is the way it is. Brother Bennett had a good idea, but unfortunately there will always be those who bend the rules. This has been the way since the beginning of sports. You had the ADFPA and the U.S.P.F. Of course both seemed power hungry, so Ernie Frantz started the APF and the world body W.P.C. I had lifted AAU until the U.S.P.F. before the IPF started the bench was performed first, then squat, and deadlift. I believe it should still be that way, but we had to make concessions with England about believe it or not gear, 30 years ago.\nThis is my point, I never made the rules, but I have always followed them. When I dropped out of the USPF, they sent a questioner on what I would change. It was a little late for that, and I never filled it out. I always wondered how I killed myself to make elite totals, suffering injuries and thousands of hours in the gym, when a judge could simply studied a book, take a test, and become a I.P.F. judge in weeks and not be a class one lifter. Big men are hard to judge in the squat. You are penalized for not breaking parallel in the squat which is very tough to do with the super strong suits we can wear by the rules. But in the bench we are rewarded by one pound of 700 touching your chest doesn’t make sense. But bench meets have become the thing. You see countless bench pressers on the cover of PLUSA. I thought its called POWERLIFTING USA not BENCH PRESSING USA. But it shows how popular bench pressing is. Even at Westside where we push the squat we have made only three all time world records, five over 1000, Matt Smith’s 1074 the highest, and ten 800 deadlifters. We have made 22 all time world bench records and 15 over 700 and one at 825. That shows what I know.\nIts 2000 and I’m doing pretty well, squat 860 at 242 with a 580 bench. I believe I was third at 920 squat and fourth in total with 2100 at 235 bwt. Now the W.P.O. is on the scene with some money. It’s amazing how money can bring people together. Kieran Kidder has brought the best lifters together for the first time since Gus Rethwich’s Hawaii Record Breaker meet, where unheard of weights were being lifted.\nThe W.P.O. format pits the greatest lifters in the top of each money division. The 165’s are unbelievable with Ron Palmer who is fairly new to powerlifting winning most of the time, but the kingpin in the 165’s is Tony Conyers with a 832 squat and a 1978 total. The guy must use mirrors. He’s also one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. He’s been at the top for years. My friend Angelo Berardinelli has also been at the top for years. He started at the famous Black’s Health World. He’s over 800 in the squat and 1900 in the total and still moving up. Angelo is a bulldog. A young lion is Nick Hatch at 148. I saw him squat an unreal 788 at the ARNOLD CLASSIC at 19 years old. He is out of Big Iron Rick Hussey’s gym.\nThe second group 181 thru 220. At the 181, our good friend Arnold Coleman broke Gene Bell’s all time total record 2116. Maybe they will rename the meet to Arnold Coleman Classic. Phil Harrington was not at the W.P.O. but squats 900 at 181. Where will it end?\nAnd yet a new star Mike Cartinian who is aiming at Jesse Kellum’s 198 total record. Mike trains with Angelo Berardinelli and Kenny Patterson. Speaking of Jesse I think he’s taking it easy back in the swamps of Louisiana training with some bad ass gators. I must say Jesse is not only one of the strongest men in many weight classes but very smart about training. I think Jesse and Chuck Vogelpohl are twin brothers from different mothers. At 220 Chuck Vogelpohl has owned the squat record at 1025 but has worn out his welcome at 220 and will compete at 242 in Atlanta Georgia. Travis Mash has rose to the top at 220 breaking Eddie Coan’s total record, not once but twice. He too will be going to 242 at the Show of Strength in Atlanta.\nThe W.P.O. has a 48 hour weigh in, which I have had doctors say is no advantage, but it sounds bad. But the 242 and 275 world record holder Steve Goggins only weighed 264 when he squatted 1102 and totaled 2535. He weighed light at 242 and totaled 2481 with a world record squat of 1043. Steve trains in Atlanta with Phil Harrington the world record holder at 181 with an unreal 900 squat, and also John Groves a veteran lifter who has been around a long time. It’s important to have a group of strong experienced lifters. Not to be left out of this group is Kara Bohigian. She is extremely strong and very knowledgeable about training.\nMark “Spud” Bartley who trains with Donny Thompson at Maximus Barbell in South Carolina is really on the rise. At he 2005 W.P.O. Super Open in Columbus Ohio he made a huge 2463 total and second place. It proves a point that the most important thing in a gym is your training partners. You can tell who’s got balls and those who pretend to have a set. How? It takes guts to lift with the strongest men in the world. Kieran has assembled the strongest and summons them to one platform. A few years ago 2400 would win the SHW class. Then it was 2500. Now Matt Smith made 2601 and was third place. And let’s not forget Gary Franks! He made the first 2500, 2600, 2700, and 2800. With Beau Moore, Andy Bolton and I hope the return of Brent Mikesell, one of the best SHW squatter around, but Moore and Bolton could claim it soon.\nBeau and Tony Conyers bought a reverse hyper from us some time back, and have made unbelievable progress since. Matt Smith wants me to re-po it from Beau, not for nonpayment but because he’s getting to be the strongest.\nAll these men are gentlemen and have nothing but good things to say about the competition. It’s always been that way with the strongest lifters. The strongest men never bad mouth a beginner or those that are not strong. But nowadays there are many on the World Wide Web that are always being disrespectable to the strongest men and women in the world. Why? What have they done? Oh yeah, nothing! These people are constantly on the web when the men who they are criticizing are training, writing articles, doing seminars. They are also going to meets and cheering on their competition, or are backstage helping putting on bench shirts or spotting someone’s warm ups.\nNo one in my humble opinion should belittle Andy Bolton’s deadlift, Brett Mikesell’s squat, Gene Rychak Jr’s bench press, or Gary Frank’s total lifts.\nAre they prepared to train beside men like these for even a year and see what they go thru? Then and only then would someone appreciate the work and sacrifice these guys go thru. It has been my goal to share what I have been taught, and what I teach thru my videos and seminars, plus the work my friends Buddy Morris college and NFL strength coach, Tommy Myslinski college and NFL player and now coach, my friends and training partners Dave Tate, Jim Wendler, George Halbert, and now Chuck Vogelpohl are giving back to their sport by giving their time to help lifters and coaches alike to learn a similar system that works for everyone.\nAfter moving to Columbus and training at Westside, Dave started E.F.S. and now not only my training partner and we compete every day in the gym. We are in competition in business with internet sales on my web site www.westside-barbell.com . now I can’t forget Paul Childers who you see perform in my workout tapes. He has contributed much to Westside Barbell from his own experiences with the Westside system. Also my Finnish friend Sarkari Selkainaho also has helped elevate the system. I want to thank my training partners most of all but I can’t thank everyone or mention their names, there are just too many. But you know who you are; my friends from Ukraine, Finland, Brazil, Japan, Ireland, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada and everywhere else. All NFL players, track athletes, MMA fighters, the late Dr. Mel Siff and all the old Soviet Union authors that brought my attention to an advance and sophisticated training system. Pavel, the kettle bell master, who has backed us for years and I back him and his team of instructors for the unrelenting teaching.\nPowerlifters please band together, I respect all federations and their motives and the direction in which they are heading. But we must travel together to achieve true success.\nI would like to thank the three Westside Barbell team doctors who work relentlessly to\nkeep us healthy; Dr. Dave Beversdorf, Dr. Bill Nucklos, and Dr. Eric Serrano.\nWith three more surgeries under my belt, powerlifting is about to pull me down, maybe for the last\ntime but as a man wrote “I won’t go slowly into the night, but I will rage on into the dying of the light.”\nLouie Simmons",

I feel like Captain Ahab with his obsession with Moby Dick. I am strapped to powerlifting, and I know I will be pulled to my chalky death by it eventually, but I can’t stop.\nAll my memories and my friends are involved in powerlifting, so I am drawn to it even more today than ever. So this is my story as I remember it.\nMy first exposure to powerlifting was a power meet in Dayton, Ohio, late in 1966.1 had Olympic lifted since I was 12 and competed at 14, doing a 175 snatch and a 260 clean/jerk at a body weight of about 155.1 really thought I was a strong guy until that first power meet. There were 11 men in the 165s and I got 10th place, beating only a 55 year old dude.\nThis was an eye opener for me. I never Olympic lifted again. My Olympic lifting training partners should have worn signs saying “I lift weights”, because if they were brought into court for it, the case would be thrown out for lack of evidence. However, the powerlifters I saw not only were strong but looked like they were strong.\nOne of these men was Milt McKinney, a future world champion in the 132s. George Crawford was amazing at 165, trying a 525 world record squat with legs like tree trunks. He later squatted 650 at 165 with no gear, when 500 was good. George was the first to help me with my squat form. He was always helpful at meets. His son came to visit years later, and it was my honor to help him.\nVince Anello was in the meet as well, showing signs of his deadlift prowess even then. Vince told me once that anything made his deadlift go up. He was doing the conjugate system without knowing it. I just saw Vince at the 2004IPFWorld Bench Championships in Cleveland, OH. He still looks great.\nThat meet in 1966 was my introduction to Larry Pacifico. He would become one of the greatest lifters I ever saw. There was nothing I did not do to try to beat him, but I never did, nor did anyone else until injuries and a technical error in the 1980 Senior Nationals cost him his chance to win 10 Worlds in a row. He would give advice on benching, which was to gain weight and work your triceps. Larry’s son is becoming quite a shot putter, throwing 60 feet as a ninth grader.\nThis group, along with Ed Matz and a few top lifters around the world had a network of training knowledge at their disposal, which was a major factor in their success.\nToday we have the Internet, but unfortunately many use it to bad-mouth each other, to cry about their training partners, or, worse, to be a legend in their own mind.\nAfter that power meet, I went into the Army. The next month I was in the infantry, but did not go to Vietnam. Instead I was sent to Berlin, I think because of my father’s untimely death in 1968. Now I could train fairly regularly, but my lifts were going nowhere. No one knew anything about powerlifting. One day I picked up a Muscle Power Builder, which later became Muscle and Fitness. In that magazine, there was a powerlifting article about the Westside Barbell Club of Culver City, California. It was about box squatting. I had never heard of this, but with nothing to lose, I gave it a try. To my amazement, the box squats worked to the point that 1 later made top 10 squats in five weight classes.\nBill West, George Frenn, and the guys, through those articles, got me started on the right foot. I\nwas never able to visit Westside in Culver City due to work, which I regret to this day.\nAfter getting out of the Army in 1969, 1 built a power rack, got some weights, and started\ntraining full time using what I learned from the articles. They were my only training partners.\nAfter Bill West died, I refer Red to my place as Westside Barbell, but never publicly until 1986. Westside Barbell is a trademarked name (and so is Louie Simmons).\n1 often wondered if I was on the right track with my training. Roger Estep was doing a 1600 total in the early 1970s. Then out of nowhere, he made an 1800 total. I asked him how he jumped 200 pounds so fast. He said he went out to Westside in Culver City, and the rest WAS history.\nChuckie Dunbar, Jack Wilson, Luke lams, Paul Sutphin, and some others were known as the Wild Bunch and were a very strong team. They proved to me that I was on the right track. My problem was that I had no training partners. When I went to meets, I would ask lifters who excelled in each lift for tips on that lift. When it came to benching, Larry Pacifico was always telling me to train my triceps and lats.\nI was lifting in Indiana and met Bill Seno. This dude was huge. He had won best chest in many Mr. American contests, but was also the American record holder in the bench press. I also asked Bill how to get my bench up to a top 10 lift (at the time there was only atop 10). First he stared at me, then grabbed me by the arms and said I needed to do illegally wide benches for a 6 rep max. When progress stopped, go to 8 reps, then to 10 reps 1 to failure. I hated the higher reps but the 6s pushed my lousy 340 at 181 to 445 at 198 then finally 480 at 220 and a top 8 bench. Bill was a close-grip bencher, and he was telling me to bench extra wide?\nWhat gives? In the end, he knew what he was talking about. Bill was training with Ernie Frantz. Ernie was 12 or 13 years than me. A former bodybuilder turned powerlifter, Ernie was old by my standards, but not old-fashioned. He was and still is on the cutting edge with power gear — denim shirts and canvas squat suits—which are still some of the best today. For years he was a top 181, 198, and 220. He also formed the APF and WPC to lift some of the restrictions of the IFF. His wife, Diane, was also a top lifter in the 1980s. There were top lifters such as Jack Barnes, who could out-squat everyone at 181 and 198, and John Kanter at 242 with a 2000 total. The heavyweights were always in the limelight: John Kuc, Jim Williams, one of the greatest benchers of all time, and Jon Cole, who made a 2370 total at 286 with no gear.\nI entered my first national meet, the Junior Nationals in Patterson, NJ, in 1971.1 got third. I thought I had second place locked up until Joe Spack, also known as Spack the Wack, came out and pulled a 650 deadlift to push me into third. I made the top10 in 1972inPowerlifting News, a Dan Dewelt publication that was the predecessor to Mike Lambert’s Powerlifting USA. In 1970,1 met Herb Glossbrenner, who thanklessly keeps stats to this day. Herb and Mike keep it real for everyone.\nMy arch rival was George Clark. This guy was built like a tank. He would always beat me by 40- 50 pounds. But what made it worse was that when he would arrive, everyone would stop and stare at him because he had muscles that did not have names yet. I dreamed about beating him every day of my life, but 1 never did. I did outlast him though.\nI made my first Elite total in February 1973 in Toledo, Ohio. I did 605 – 380 – 670 and a 1655 total. At that time there was no gear. I almost made a 700 deadlift. A lot of good lifters, including Bill Ennis and Ed Matz, participated in that meet. It was known as The Key to the Sea.\nThe Chattanooga Open was a big, but not national, meet as well. After that meet, I said to myself that my back was indestructible. Boy, was I wrong. I broke my fifth lumbar vertebra. I was on and off crutches for 10 months and in severe pain. I could not do any exercises that had made me strong before. By luck, I came up with the Reverse Hyper. It first helped the pain, and then it repaired my back to its former strength.\nWalter Thomas was new and on the rise in the early 1970s. Inaba, Precious McKenzie, Eddie Pengelly, and Ron Collins were making names for themselves. Powerlifting was becoming international. The IPF was formed to organize the first world power sport. The AAU had run powerlifting in the beginning. The early 1970s was the springboard for U.S. powerlifting.\nA lot of Canadians would lift in our meets in Ohio. I don’t think Dr. Di Pasquale was one of them, but everyone knows him today by his column in Powerlifting USA. A lot of powerlifters hang on forever. Bob Cortes was in many meets in the early 1970s. I recall he was older than dirt then, and he is still lifting today.\nIn the 19 71 Junior Nationals I broke the squat record with 565, breaking the mark held by Tony Fratto, who was a huge influence in my squatting. Its funny how although you are competing against these great lifters, they were also great men, as they were the pioneers of this great sport. I trained by myself until I saw Doug Heath at Ohio State University. He was strong as hell, but really eccentric, to say the least. He had many great contests with Ron Mercer of Glass City Power Team, in Toledo. Doug is still strong today, making top 10 lifts. After my back injury, it took me a few years to reach top form again. Spanjian supersuits came on the scene. They did not do much, but I was glad to have some support. I recall that they cost $24.00. Bob’s Belts supplied a 4 inch power belt, which I still use today.\nLarry Pacifico was not only lifting big, but was putting on the greatest power meets ever. I lifted in the 1977 Junior Nationals in Lincoln, NE. It was the first time I saw Fred Hatfield. He would become a squatting machine, maybe the greatest pure squatter of all time. I met a kid there who told me he was going to break the world record in the bench at 148. His name was Mike Bridges. He did break the record. I never saw such a lifting machine. He was and is the strongest man under 200 pounds I ever saw. If he would choose to use the best gear of today, it would be crazy. My friend Arnold Coleman broke Mike’s and Gene Bell’s total record at the 2005 Arnold Classic. I was amazed to see Arnold break these records. It was unexpected, but the unexpected is commonplace today.\nSam Mangialardi, Dennis Reed, and Henry Waters were making big noise, as well as Clyde Wright, Larry Kidney, and Paul Wrenn, who at super heavyweight sure could squat deep. I was now a 198. Estep, Jones, Cash, and my new training partner, Gary Sanger, were doing big lifts. In 1978, I was strong again: fourth in the squat, seventh in the deadlift with 710, and fifth in the total at 1825.1 wanted to go to 220, but had a hard time gaining weight. I thought my injuries were behind me, so I go to the 1979 Senior Nationals. Bridges is killing then, but Ricky Crain is right there. Walter Thomas was at the top of his game. I was there to beat Pacifico like everyone else. I did everything I could to beat him, but — of course — I didn’t, but neither could anyone else.\nThe 1979 Seniors was known as the Meltdown in Mississippi, for good reason. Bill Kazmaier was making a name for himself and had planned to dominate the meet. I was sitting poolside with some lifters when Bill said, “Beam me up Scotty.” His luck got worse when he bombed out with an 804 deadlift. He would have won by over 100 pounds. It was very humid, which caused a lot of missed deadlifts. I weighed only 212 and made a 733 PR squat and a PR bench of 462. My opener of 677 would place me second behind Larry Pacifico. I pulled the weight easy, but as I locked it out, my grip slipped a little. The head referee was looking at my hand, and then my bicep tore loose, causing me to drop the bar. My second place quickly became no place. What a meet. Only two made a total: Larry and Dr. Steve Miller.\nTo this day, people ask me where’s your bicep? I reply, “Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.” Two surgeons recommended surgery, but one said no, and that’s the way 1 went. Many people asked if I was going to lift again. I said, “Hell yes.” Six months later, in January 1980, at the Y Nationals, I was back. I squatted 765, benched 480 (my first top 10 bench), and deadlifted 705, to total 1950. It was the third best total ever, for a short time. That’s the good news. The bad news was that I had hurt my groin and lower abs. I was in extreme pain, but I was getting to like pain, maybe a little too much.\nNext stop, the 1980 Senior Nationals in Wisconsin. I opened with 722, but failed. I made my second attempt, but with a lot of pain and a popping sound. For the first time I.used my head and passed the rest of the meet. Ernie Hackett, a world record holder and physical therapist, looked at me and said I had torn tendons of the pelvic bone and some lower ab muscles. He was right, and I was out for a while.\nMeanwhile, Larry Pacifico had won his ninth world championship at the 1979 Worlds in his hometown of Dayton, OH. Japan, England, and Canada had world champs along with the United States. At the 1979 Worlds Lamar Gant beat Precious McKenzie at 123 by pulling a 617 deadlift. The world record was 551, and Lamar made 617 to a standing ovation, the only one I’ve ever seen. With there being only one federation, my main goal was to do top 10 lifts in my third weight class. I had some time to think about training. I knew I was doing something wrong because I was stronger in training than at the meets. After breaking my fifth lumbar vertebra for the second time in 1983, 1 sought medical advice. The doctor wanted to remove two disks, fuse my back, and remove bone spurs. I said, ‘No way, Jose’. In next month’s article the story and the pain continue.\nLouie Simmons",

Accommodation causes your performance to stagnate or decrease. Zatsiorsky stated that the response of a biological object to a given constant stimulus decreases over time.\nFor example, a football team will practice for hours and hours, but when game time arrives, there are off-sides, holding, missed tackles, and fumbles. Why? Could it be they practice the game too much and not the parts of the game that cause the difficulties on game day?\nHow can a high school basketball player like Labron James be the number 1 pick in the NBA? Is it because they have forgotten the fundamentals of basketball and merely play the game as a whole? Now a junior high school player from Indianapolis is projected to be the top NBA pick after graduation next year. How? Are they concerned only with the entertainment value of the game and nothing else? Perhaps.\nIs that why we can’t win Olympic gold with superstar millionaires?\nThe U.S. Olympic lifters have a technique day. Why? The last world record by a male U.S. lifter was in 1969, Joe Dube. Olympic lifters, like ballplayers, repeat the same activities over and over, only to stagnate after a short time. I had to mention Olympic lifters so I can receive my fair share of hate email. I always have the door open at Westside for them, but only Glen Pendlay has made the trip.\nOf course, all of us can experience becoming stale. How can we train the squat without experiencing accommodation? At Westside we box squat, but we change the box height occasionally or use a soft box (hassock) instead. Most of us change the width of our stance during the same workout or point the feet at different angles. Everyone carries the bar at the same place on the back. We instinctively do this to take advantage of our best leverage. This is, in itself, good. However what about the muscles you avoid training by doing this? How can they be trained?\nUsing different bars can train neglected areas. We use a 3-week pendulum wave, going from 50% to 60% in 3 weeks, then returning to 50%, etc.\nA Safety Squat bar may be used for 3 weeks. A second loading maybe done with a cambered bar for the next 3 weeks. Then perhaps a straight bar or even a Manta Ray can be used for a wave.\nTo reduce accommodation to a greater extent, one must include methods to accommodate resistance. This is done by including chains, bands, or weight releasers amount of bands and chains added to the barbell weight. A combination of bands, chains, or weight releasers with different amounts of each must be used as well.\nAnother proven method of changing the amount of work being done is to change the length of the rest time between sets. This is reflected by the intensity zone being used. Speed strength rest intervals can vary from 30 to 90 seconds between sets. For circa-max weights the rest can be 60 seconds to 2 minutes and 30 seconds. This max depends on your GPP.\nFor bench pressing, the same procedure is used. For dynamic benching, one can use chains, bands, weight releasers, or a combination of the three. Instead of the regular bench press for speed work one can floor press. This breaks up the eccentric/concentric chain.\nA different method is to do speed work by lowering the bar to power rack pins, relax the muscles on the pins, and then press up. The type of bar used can also disrupt the process of accommodation. You can use a fat bar, a Buffalo bar, or a MacDonald bar with a 5-inch or 3- inch camber.\nEvery time you change something and master its performance, you become a better lifter or athlete.\nThe deadlift can be trained by doing box deadlifts off a 2- or 4- inch box, or you can do rack pulls varying from having the plates 2 inches off the floor to having the bar set at knee height or slightly higher. It is important to do ‘both sumo and conventional styles.\nThe deadlift can be done with Jump-Stretch bands over the bar. A doubled mini-band adds 220 pounds at the top and about 100 pounds at the floor level. A monster mini-band will add 280 pounds at the top and 125 at the start. For more top-end tension, a single light band adds 100 pounds mostly at lock-out.\nThe lightened method is also used frequently at Westside. This is done by suspending the bar in strong bands 5 feet off the floor. This reduces the bar weight by 135 pounds at the floor level. At lock-out the entire bar weight originates from the bands. This creates a different type of speed of resistance. Don’t forget good mornings of different types.\nFinally, let’s look at the Olympic lifts. We know because of accommodation that it is not advised to use standard exercises for a long cycle. The loading system must change as well. We have found that a 3-week wave works best.\nA note to college coaches: a full clean & jerk is two lifts: a front squat and the jerk. If one simply tries to increase the C/J, it is only a matter of time before failure strikes. A lifter may he quick to jump under the bar, but may not be able to recover from the squat. The front squat must be pushed up, not by front squatting, but by doing special exercises for the front squat. For example, back squat off a low box with a full 2-second relaxed pause or front squat off a box with a long relaxed pause. Use a variety of bars, e.g., Buffalo bar, 14-inch-cambered bar, Safety Squat bar, in addition to the Reverse Hyper machine, pull-throughs, 45-degree hypers, heavy glute/ham raises, inverse curls, belt squats, weighted sled pulls, and pistol squats. Use bands and chains, plus weight releasers. For pulling, use at least two grips for cleans and snatches. Stand on a 2-inch platform for power-cleans and power-snatches. Do straight-leg power-cleans and power- snatches. Use kettle bells with one or both hands. Do functional isometric pulls adjusted with bands. This is just a small list.\nIt must be said that in the beginning proper form should he taught early in the training of novices. Then more exercises for strength are added to the training. This is the conjugate method, where special exercises will correct technical flaws. Most of the exercises I have talked about are close in form to the classical lifts.\nThe training volume must greatly differ from workout to workout. This means total volume as well as intensity zone. Ben Tabachnik, inventor of the track parachute, said, “to never adapt to training is to adapt to training.” And this is our philosophy also. There are 35 men who have totaled 2400 or more. At Westside we have 25 members and five of them total over 2400. They have accomplished this by not falling into the trap of accommodation. You must plan for specificity, which means whatever will raise a particular lift. It seldom is possible to just do this lift. I believe that is why power-lifters are the most successful of all weight sports. Just think for a minute how many special training devices powerlifters use for each lift. There must be 20 for each. For this, I applaud all my powerlifting friends all around the world.\nLouie Simmons",

Many of the meets are small and mostly in Ohio. We like to represent Ohio. Top lifters should lift in their respective states to entice new talent into the sport.\nWe also attend the biggest meets: APF Senior Nationals, IPA Nationals, IPA World Cup, WPO Bash for Cash, WPO Show of Strength, and the WPO Finals at the Arnold Classic in Columbus, Ohio, our home base.\nWhile the squat used to be a crap shoot, it’s now the bench that causes the most bomb- outs of late. Sometimes the shirt is too strong. Sometimes the lifter is too weak. Confidence will make you a champ; overconfidence will make you a chump. We must come to grips with the fact that bench shirts are here to stay. Some prefer to lift “raw”. If one has a sense of history and remembers names such as Mike MacDonald, Larry Pacifico, Jeff Magruder, and of course Jim Williams (675 in 1972 at SHW), the truth is that what people think is good raw benching today is mostly pretty sad. But what does it take to bench a personal record at contest time?\nMany things come to mind. The first is methods of training. There are three standard methods of training.\nDynamic Method\nHere, one uses submaximal weights with maximum speed. This method teaches the\nlifter to display explosive strength and to improve the rate of force development.\nMaximum Effort Method\nThis is defined by lifting the heaviest weight possible for 1 rep with no time limit, or without a large emotional stress, meaning a training max, not a contest max.\nAt Westside, the above two methods occur 72 hours apart. Repetition to Near Failure\nWestside lives on special exercises, but reps are done to near failure for triceps, lats, and delts, basically the muscle groups that are used in the three lifts.\nThe problem today is the popularity of bench shirts and their ability to raise one’s bench considerably. There are some who will only do shirt work, that is, doing band pressing with a bench shirt. The lifter will set the shirt to barely touch three boards, and then adjust it to touch two boards, and finally crank the shirt to maximally work on one board.\nIn our gym, George Halbert’s group did just this for months, only to discover that it did not work. They became very good on board pressing with a shirt, only to find that they had no groove or, even worse, the ability to touch their chest. This resulted in a lot of bomb-outs.\nAt our gym, 20 feet away from George’s group, a second group tried the same routine, also coming to the same conclusion. This time, four top lifters had miserable results. Only one out of four made a bench, and it was 70 pounds under his best. Why? Using a bench shirt is not max effort work. The shirt is doing the work, not the lifter. Remember the three main methods of training? The shirt work replaced max effort work, but not really. All of a sudden, they couldn’t lock out weights that were easy before. Some did not do speed work.\nThe dynamic method is not intended to raise maximal strength, but to teach you to display explosive strength and to improve the rate of force development. Zatsiorsky explains this in Science and Practice of Strength Training. I have heard many say that speed is not important. This is wrong thinking. A particular lifter has only so long to complete a max lift. You will fail to lift more weight when your muscles are contracted for a given time limit. The sprinter can only sprint so far before decelerating. The top sprinters accelerate a longer distance than a novice sprinter. The stronger a man or woman is, the shorter period he or she can exert maximal force. This is why speed and acceleration are so important.\nWhen using a shirt in training, it takes a long time to work up to a max. Remember, your testosterone will drop rapidly after 45 minutes. This is why dense training is a must. Dense training refers to how much training is done in a particular time limit versus how much rest is taken during the same time limit. When putting a shirt on and taking it off, actual training time is limited. This results in little time for exercises for the triceps, delts, pecs, and lats to be done. One must learn to use a shirt, but one must learn to touch the chest. Bill Crawford says that you must touch the chest.\nI suggest, instead of board pressing with a bench shirt, have a shirt that you can touch 450 and establish a max record in that shirt, let’s say 510. Next use a shirt that allows you to touch500 and possibly a max of 570, and finally a 550 shirt and find your max with that shirt, I’m guessing maybe 625. A bigger bencher would use three stronger bench shirts. A lesser bencher, say 400 max, would do the same with a weaker set of shirts.\nToday anybody can achieve a big bench fast due to the perfection of bench shirts. But soon after your bench tops out, you must become physically stronger. If you don’t, you will disappear from the power scene. The answer is, of course, learning to use a bench shirt, but also learning to raise your natural strength.\nGeorge Halbert has set 11 all-time world records in the bench in three weight classes, yet recently made an all-time gym personal record of 625 without a bench shirt, prior to making 746 and 766 at Kieran Kidder’s Bash for Cash in Orlando in September 2004 during a hurricane.\nFred Boldt, at 181, made 597 in Orlando with George. He also made a 622 world record only to have it turned down for a technicality. George and Fred both do shirt work on the chest in the gym.\nAs a second and more successful experiment, Joe Bayles, who had a 630 bench, made 700 pounds in a full meet and totaled 2325 at 242. Mike Brown, at 19 years old, made a 735 bench and totaled 2300 in his first meet at 295 bodyweight. Tim Harold hit a 715 bench and totaled 2455 at SHW, at 20 years old. Zach Cole went from a 575 to a 600 bench at 276. This group did shirt work off thir chest. Most of the board work was done without a shirt. Joe made a 605 2-board press with no shirt prior to his 700 at the IPA Nationals in 2004.\nNowhere have I read that wearing a bench shirt is max effort work. The shirt is doing the work, not the muscular system of the lifter. In fact, your true max strength will decrease, as we found out.\nRecently I have seen four lifters break their arm doing a contest bench. I believe this is due to training short-cuts. As one buys a stronger bench shirt, they neglect to train harder to become stronger. Something has to give, and it is the lifter. So if you are going to spend a lot of cash for a shirt, try spending some time getting stronger. Musashi Miyarnoto said, “to do nothing is worthless.”\nLouie Simmons",

But when one looks at the deadlift, there are only 8 900+ deadlifters. The incredibly strong Eddie Coan made 901 at 220 in 1991. He is by far the lightest of the group. My old friend Danny Wohleber, of Cleveland, OH, was the youngest, at 21 years old in 1982, and at a bodyweight of 268. This brief bit of history illustrates how difficult the deadlift truly is.\nWe also got lazy in the deadlift. After all, Ted Arcidi made the first official 700 (705) bench in 1985. Now, at least 65 others have done that much. My old friend Dave Waddington made the first 1000 (1003) pound squat in 1981. Now we have 35 and the number is growing.\nI believe there are several reasons for this. One is the lack of supportive gear in the deadlift. Put down a few Benjamins for a better bench shirt and squat suit and your bench and squat will probably go up. Although there are deadlift suits, they don’t have the same impact as other power gear.\nExcept for Eddie Coan, most men found it necessary to gain a large amount of weight, which helped the squat, but destroyed the leverage needed to pull such weight. Only three out of the eight made at least 3 times bodyweight.\nWhat can be done for the deadlift? Well, let’s try training. First, speed pulls are a necessity to pull big weights. We have had great success with Jump-Stretch band pulls. Our platform is designed to provide 100 pounds of tension at the start and 220 pounds at lock-out. The bar weight is about 60-65% of your meet deadlift. We also will add more band tension at the lock-out only, leaving the original start tension the same.\nA second method is to drape chains over the bar. For a 700+ pull, use three or four sets of 5/8 inch chains that are 5 feet long. A variation of the chain method is to attach the chain to the platform on one end. As the bar is pulled upward, the chain will fall on the bar at any height desired.\nThe lightened method is also used quite often for speed work. We place the\nstrong blue bands over the power rack pins at 5 ft. 6 in. off the floor. This will reduce 135 pounds to about zero at the floor. The bar weight is 70% of your best pull. All speed pulls should be done right after speed squats for 5-8 singles.\nMax Effort Work\nWestside lives on good mornings of all types.\n*Concentric good mornings. Here we support the bar in chains suspended from the top of our power rack. We work up to a max single. It may look like a half-squat/half- good morning. Regardless of your form, if you break your record, you are stronger.\n*Bentleg arched-back good mornings. *Bent.back bent=legged good mornings. *straightleg arched-back good mornings. *Good mornings with heels raised.\nGood mornings with one foot raised 2-4 inches.\nGood mornings with weights and bands\nGood mornings with weights and chains\nGood mornings with weights, chains and bands\nSquatting for the deadlift\n*Very low box squats will build a large deadlift. Squat off a box that is 2-4 inches lower than the box you use for training the squat.\n*Safety squat bar. *MantaRay squats. *Buffalo bar on a low box. *l4inch cambered bar.\n*Dave Draper’s squat device, which rapidly changes the body position. This is precisely why squatting with special bars work; they artificially change the length of the spine.\n*Belt squats. These build tremendous leg strength without taxing the back.\nDeadlifts\n*Ultrawide deadlifts, sumo style. This develops extremely strong hip muscles. Tim Harold went from a hard 700 pull to an easy 775 pull in 3 month’s time.\nRack pulls. Choose pins that allow only about 10% over your best regular deadlift.\n*If you pull conventional, try a sumo record. One style will help the other. One must also use special exercises to increase the deadlift. Very few lifters can excel by only deadlifting. I’ve already talked about good mornings and special squats, but there are exercises that isolate certain muscle groups. The deadlift is done for singles, squats 1-3 reps, and good mornings 1-5 reps. The special exercises below are to be done in the 6-12 rep range or higher.\n*Glute-ham raises. These are to be done to 2-10 reps per set, depending on the amount of weight used. You can increase the difficulty of this exercise by raising the rear of the glute-ham bench. Sometimes this version is referred to as an inverse curl.\n*Pull-throughs. Face away from a low-pulley device, grab a single handle attachment connected to the cable, and walk forward a few feet. Squat down with the arms straight and stand back up.\n*Modified glute-ham raises. Do these on a 45 degree hyper bench. While performing a back raise with a bar on your back, simply perform a partial glute-ham raise simultaneously.\n*Belt squats. Use a belt squat machine or stand on boxes using a belt from which you can suspend weight. These not only build the entire lower body but also correct pelvic tilt.\n“Band leg curls. Attach a band around the lower support of a power rack. Place a bench about 4 feet from the rack. Hook your heels in the band, sit on the bench, and do leg curls.\n*Band good mornings. Place a band around your neck and stand on the other end.\nNext, work the abs in many forms.\nDeadlift Technique\nFor conventional deadlifts, for poor lock-out, the feet should be pointed straight ahead.\nThis will allow the hips to rotate forward farther and stronger. If the feet are turned out, less hip rotation is achieved.\nFor sumo style, always push the feet apart while pulling. This brings the hips forward as fast as possible, increasing leverage. The strongest style is feet straight forward. How straight your feet will be is dependent on your flexibility, which also determines the width of your stance. Push the feet apart and pull backward toward the body. This keeps the shoulders above or, hopefully behind the bar.\nI learned to deadlift from many, but Mike Bridges was most instrumental in my technique and teaching technique. My old friend Vince Anello taught me that it takes many exercises besides the deadlift to excel at it. When asked what make his deadlift so great, 821 at 198, Vince replied, “anything makes my deadlift go up.’ He was right. For grip, Ed Coan told me to train the fingers to hold on to the bar. Training the forearms makes them bigger and your hands thicker, making your grip worse.\nI hope some of these tips get you a new record in the deadlift.\nLouie Simmons",

Its purpose is not to build maximal strength but to improve the rate of force development and explosive strength. Of course, the lighter the load, the faster the rate of force development. Yuri Verkhoshansky is referred to as the father of plyometrics. His work on shock training is well documented from the early 1970s.\nExercises consisted of depth jumps, plyometrics, bounding, and medicine ball work, leading to a few special devices. What is the shock method? It’s a system of impulsive actions of the shortest duration of time beginning at the end of an eccentric phase and the beginning of the concentric, or overcoming, phase. It is a process of a fast stretch followed by a voluntary action. At near Earth, the speed of gravity is 9.8 meters per second. When an athlete drops off a box to the floor then immediately rebounds, the energy is kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is transferred into the soft tissue and connective tissue of the body. Remember, one should be able to squat 2 times bodyweight before attempting to use plyometrics.\nA 300 pound man may not safely land from a high-altitude drop of the same magnitude as a 150 pound man. Why? It’s dangerous. Kinetic energy 12 increases when mass or velocity is increased: KE = / mv . From this equation, one can see that increasing the velocity of an object has a greater effect on the kinetic energy than increasing the mass of an object. As you increase the velocity, the kinetic energy becomes exponentially greater. Velocity can be increased through the use of bands. If you merely drop off a box and land on a surface, you are moving at 9.8 meters/second. The kinetic energy is proportional to your mass and speed. Two different masses fall at the same speed, but a larger mass will have more force upon landing and even greater force when acceleration is added by attaching bands with a great amount of tension at both the top and bottom of the landing. Newton’s second law states that force = mass x acceleration. Awhile ago, we did a study at Westside to measure the effect of bands.\nWe found that when box squatting with weight only, the eccentric phase was approximately 1.6 seconds with 550 pounds on the bar. However, when using a large amount of bands and a small amount of weight, the eccentric phase was 0.52 seconds, 3 times faster. Here, a virtual force occurs, i.e., a force that is present but not recognized. For example, a certain thickness of ice can support a 50 pound ball without breaking. If the ball is dropped from a distance, moving at 9.8 meters/second, it breaks the ice on landing. Although it still weighs the same, it had acceleration in the second case. This is the case when squatting with bands. When we land on the box, a virtual force occurs due to acceleration. We do not use depth drops. Rather, we use a swing. It is much like the one in Figure 6.12 in the book `!Science and Practice of Strength Training`! by Zatsiorsky. That swing can be changed by increasing the mass and range of motion. Our Virtual Force Swing does the same. In addition, we can adjust the amount of speed desired. It is designed to convert potential energy into kinetic energy.\nWe know through physics that increasing the mass is not as effective as increasing the velocity in order to increase kinetic energy. When inanimate objects such as pool balls collide, no kinetic energy is lost; this reaction is referred to as perfectly elastic. However, in humans, it is somewhat different, due in part to the inhibition of myotactic reflex receptors. Mechanical efficiency (ME) has been studied for years. In studies by Margaria (1968), Kaneko (1984), and Acra and Komi (1986), they show that the velocity of shortening or stretching influences the value of ME. It is also known that the stretch- shortening cycle will cause very different loading conditions with different ME (`!Strength and Power in Sport`!, Komi). Having said this, it is easy to see why the Virtual Force Swing (patent pending, 2004) is so effective. Potential energy of the tendons and soft muscle tissue can be released two ways. If it is done slowly, the energy is released slowly. If done fast with a short amortization phase, it produces a high level of power.\nJust imagine the advantage of a swing where it is possible to adjust mass and velocity. There is much known about the eccentric phase. It causes most muscular soreness or delayed onset of muscular soreness. This soreness can reduce dynamic strength and damage the myofibrils and connective tissue (Friden, 1983). Eccentric work can generate much higher forces due to the tension-generating capacity of the connective tissue. This can cause an increase in tensile strength of the tendons and other elastic components of the muscle complex (Garrett, 1986). When high-velocity eccentric work is introduced progressively, it enables the connective tissue to resist high-impact forces that accompany high-impact activities such as jumping, running, and depth jumps.\nHigh-speed or overspeed eccentrics are vital to superior training and results. When squatting or benching, during the eccentric phase you will invariably descend slower as the weight grows heavier. This is not conducive to speed strength. It’s as simple as this: if lowering a barbell slowly is right, then plyometrics are wrong. But we know that’s not true. Remember our experiment with overspeed eccentrics using a high percentage of band tension versus a lower percentage of bar weight? The same is true for the Virtual Force Swing. Using a large amount of bands to increase velocity and adding weight plates to change mass will produce a very positive training effect. Increasing velocity has a much greater effect on kinetic energy than increasing mass. This kinetic energy is transformed into reversal strength.\nThe Virtual Force Swing is essential for sports requiring extreme strength or explosive power during take-offs and landings and for jumping, sprinting, or lifting. Its value cannot be duplicated in any other way due to the fact that one will invariably use more eccentric muscle tension and slow the yielding phase, causing a lessening effect on the reversal phase.\nLouie Simmons",

When I talk about bench training, I am referring to my lifters with a 550 bench or better; that’s who we experiment with.\nOn speed day for the bench, while doing the 8-10 sets of 3 reps, the chains are attached in the following manner. Loop a 1/4-inch-link chain with a hook around the bar sleeve to regulate the height of the 5/8-inch-link chain (5 feet long). Run the 5/8 chain through the metal loop and adjust it so that half of the 5/8 chain is lying on the floor while the bars in the rack. Use 60% of a no-shirt max on the bar. For example, if your max is 500, put 300 pounds on the bar. When the bar is on your chest, only the weight of the bar should be on your chest; that is, all the 5/8 chain should be on the floor.\nIf your best bench is 250 pounds or less, use one pair of 1/2-inch-link chains; these weigh 23 pounds a set, so you are locking out an extra 11.5 pounds. A 350 or more bencher should use one pair of 5/ 8-inch-link chain. By doing this, you will be locking out an extra 20 pounds. (They weigh 20 pounds each, but half is on the floor at lockout.) A 500 pound bencher can use both the 5/8 and 1/2 inch chains for a combined added weight of 31 pounds. A 600 bencher uses two 5/8 chains and sometimes adds a 1/2 inch chain, for 40 or 51 added pounds at lock- out.\nYou can experiment on your own, but remember this process is to build bar speed and acceleration. It also teaches you to launch the bar off your chest. A special note: Lower the bar fast and try to catch and reverse the weight as fast as possible. Never pause.\nOn max effort day, warm up to 315, then do a single. Next, add a 5/8 inch chain on each side and do a single. On the next set, use two sets of chain, then three sets, and so forth. This is similar to how a bench shirt works: the weight is less at the bottom and much greater at the top. The chains build not only acceleration but also a fast start and a strong lock-out.\nFor floor pressing, simply drape the 5/8 inch chain over the sleeve of the bar and you’re ready. J.M. Blakley and George Halbert do a lot of floor presses like this. George will use 200 pounds of chain (5 sets of chain) and works up to a single. His best at a bodyweight of 220 is 440 plus 200 pounds of chain, which is 640 at the top.\nJ.M. uses a different combination of weight and chains. ,J.M.s best is 400 pounds on the bar with 7 sets of chains, for a combined weight of 680 at lockout. Try any weight-to-chain ratio. Feel free to experiment. A cambered bar can be used as well.\nThese are a few methods to add to your max effort day.\nBands are a little tough for some on speed day because of the added eccentric properties they create. Also the weight resistance is much more radical at different positions: much less at the bottom, but much greater at the top. Remember, the bands are literally pulling down on you.\nThere are three bands with different strengths: pink is the least strong, for 300 pound benchers and below; green for 300-450 pound benchers; and blue for 500 pound benchers and above (shirtless max).\nWhen using bands, be careful not to overdue it. The bands produce a large amount of eccentric overloading and can cause exces-sive soreness, but they are more than worth it. They build the lockout as well as the start. One realizes very fast that you have to outrun the bands, so you develop a fast start to enable you to lock out a heavy weight.\nThe most popular methods us-ing the bands are as follows. On max effort day, do board presses with four 2 x 6’s. Loop the bands through the bottom supports of the bench and then around the sleeve of the bar. When using four boards, the tension is never released. Be-cause of this, a quick start is impossible and locking out a heavyweight is really tough. To make it even tougher, use a cambered bar. ‘J.M. presses’ with bands are very popular at Westside. To make it as tough as possible, use several bands. Lower the bar straight down, aiming between the nipples and chin, stop 4-5 inches off the chest, and press back up. Use a close grip.\nBands and chains are often used for triceps extensions. This will radically change the strength curve of the movement by accommodating resistance (lifts are usually easier at the top).\nA Westside supporter who con-stantly bugs me with some of the craziest ideas actually came up with an exercise that really works. So thanks to Doug Ebert for the follow-ing band exercise. Attach a blue band to the bar and start with 95 or 135 pounds because this is tough. Then take a pink or green band, depending on your strength, twist it once, and place it around your upper back so the tension is pulling back your hands. Now lie down on the bench, stretch the band to grab the bar, and start benching. This ‘double’ tension is unreal.\nAlso try the ‘lightened’ method, recommended by Carl of Jump-Stretch. Attach a set of blue bands to the top of the power rack with a slip knot. Load the bar to 135. It should be almost weightless at the chest. This way you can bench 135 pounds more than normal. This builds tremendous power at lockout, which is perfect for bench shirts.\nBands and chains have helped to increase our list of 550 benchers at Westside to 17. George Halbert recently benched 688 at 235 to capture the world record at 242. George also holds the 220 world record. Only two people can claim to hold a world record bench in two weight classes: George Halbert and Dave Waterman.\nNow on to squatting. With an army of 800+ squatters, 22 to be exact, when we experiment and establish results, they are sound and proven. We also have a 755 squat-ter at 165 and a 782 squatter at 181. They all use chains and bands. Here’s how.\nFirst use a set of 1/4-inch-link chains that attach to the bar sleeves. We suspend a metal ring from the 1/4 inch chains, which regulates height of the 5/8 chain from the floor. Loop the 5/8 inch chain through the metal ring so about three chain links are lying on the floor when you are standing. When you are sitting on the box, slightly below parallel, half of the chain will be unloaded onto the floor.\nHow much chain should you use? If you squat 350 or less, use one set of 5/8 inch chain, equaling 40 pounds at the top. If you squat about 600 pounds, use about 60 or 70 pounds of chain at the top. If you squat 800 pounds, use 80~120 pounds of chain at the top. As you can see, about 10% of your squat weight should be added with chain. If you are doing sets wIth 400 on the bar, you will be standing up with 520. An 800 squatter whose top training weight is 480, or 60%, will add 80-120 pounds of chain to the bar, equaling 600 at the top.\nTo use bands for squatting, if you squat 650 or less, use green bands. If you squat more than 650, use blue bands. Here are two ex-amples of 900+ squatters. Billy Masters and Dave Barno used a top weight of 500 pounds and 150 pounds of tension with blue bands. Billy did 909 and Dave did a perfect 925. Neither train at Westside, but they use our methods.\nWhen squatting, wave your training weights from 50% to 60% in a 3 or 4 week cycle. Do mostly 8 sets of 2 reps with 45 seconds rest between sets.\nFor max effort work, one can choose a bar weight of, say, 400 or 500 pounds. Do a single and then add a set of chains. Keep doing singles and adding a second and third set of chains until you break a PR or miss. You can do the same with Flex bands. Good mornings are a great exercise to do with chains and bands. High pulls with the pink or green bands are also great.\nI have seen one of our lifters with a 600 deadlift go to 670 in 6 months by using bands on the deadlift. Bob Young would use 275-315 on the bar, with about 200 pounds of tension from the bands. We use the platform that Jump-Stretch sells with their bands to do this exercise.\nIf you want to excel at powerlifting or any sport, then you must develop speed strength, increase acceleration, and gain absolute strength. Bands and chains can be instrumental in developing these aspects of strength. I highly recom-mend that you try them as soon as possible.\nLearn more about “Accommodating Resistance” please view our Webinar\nLouie Simmons",

This is, in my opinion, the safest way to squat because you don’t use as much weight as you would with a regular squat.\nLet me say first that, no, they won’t hurt your spine, you don’t use1000 lbs. on a 25 inch tall box, you don’t rock on the box, you don’t touch and go, and there is no need to do regular power squats before a meet. No knee wraps are worn nor are the straps of the suit pulled up.\nBy doing sets of 2 reps for at least 8 sets with short rest periods, you will get about a 200 lb. carryover to your regular squat. Two of our lifters finished their lifting cycle before a meet with 8 sets of 2 reps with 505 lbs. off a slightly below parallel box, and both squatted 700 for a meet PR One was competing in the 242s and the other as a 275. Two years before, in his first meet, our 275 pounder squatted 465 – quite an improvement!\nThere are many advantages to box squatting. One of the most important is recuperation. You can train more often on a box than you can doing regular squats. The original Westside boys (Culver City, CA) did them three times a week, which I feel is a bit extreme, but they paved the way for this type of training. We do them for the squat part of our workout on Fridays and occasionally on Mondays to build hip and low back power for deadlifting. The NBA’s Utah Jazz do box squats for the same reason – recuperation. Greg Shepherd, their strength coach, is a former member of the Culver City gym.\nThe second reason is equally important. It is generally accepted that you should keep your shins perpendicular to the floor when squatting. With box squatting, you can go past this point (that is, an imaginary line drawn from your ankle to your knee will point toward your body), which places all the stress on the major squatting muscles- hips, glutes, lower back, and hamstrings. This is a tremendous advantage.\nThirdly, you don’t have to ask anyone if you were parallel. Once you establish a below parallel height, all of your squats will be just that -below parallel. I have seen it over and over. As the weights get heavier, the squats get higher. This can’t happen with box squats.\nIf your hips are weak, use a below parallel box with a wide stance. If you need low back power, use a close stance, below parallel. If your quads are weak, work on a parallel box. If you have a sticking point about 2 inches above parallel, as is common, then work on a box that is 2 inches above parallel. Our advanced squatters use all below parallel boxes. This builds so much power out of the hole that there will be no sticking points.\nAs an added bonus, box squats will build the deadlift as well by overloading the hips and lower back muscles. Your ability to explode off the floor will increase greatly. One of our 275 pounders, Jerry Obradovich, put 50 lbs. on his dead lift in 3 months by doing extra box squats during that time period, going from 672 to 722 at the 1994 APF Junior Nationals. Chuck Vogelpohl deadlifts only about once in 8 weeks yet pulls 793 in the 242s. Chuck relies on wide box squats on a low, 12-inch box and does a lot of reverse hypers®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 and chest-supported rows.\nNow, how do you do a box squat? They are performed just like regular squats. Fill your abdomen with air, and push out against your belt. Push your knees out as far as possible to the sides and with a tightly arched back, squat back, not down, until you completely sit on the box. Every muscle is kept tight while on the box with the exception of the hip flexors. By releasing and then contracting the hip flexors and arching the upper back, you will jump off the box, building tremendous starting strength. Remember to sit back and down, not straight down. Your hamstrings will be strengthened to a high degree, which is essential. Many don’t know this, but the hamstrings are hip extensors. Some great squatters have large quads and some do not, but they all have large hamstrings where they tie into the glutes. Remember to sit on the box completely and flex off.\nNow, how do you know how much you can full squat if you box squat all the time? Well, let’s say you have squatted 600 lbs. in a meet and decided to box squat. Let’s say you can do 550 off a parallel box; that’s a 50-lb. carry-over. Now you are doing only box squats and you take a weight 4-6 weeks into the cycle. You hit a 575 squat, a 25-lb. jump on that particular box. This will carry over to your 600 contest best. So now expect a 625 at your next meet.\nI recommend that you train with 65-82% of your box record on each particular box height that you use. Change box heights every 3-4 weeks. Do not base the training weight on your full squat record! Box squats are much harder than full squats! Do 8-12 sets of 2 reps with 1 minute rest between sets. This is a tough workout! The week that you reach 82%, reduce the sets to 6. Don’t train with more than 82%. You can try a max the after you train with 82%. If you are going to a meet, take a weight 2 weeks before the meet. The week before the meet use 70% for 6-8 sets.\nThis type of squatting is hard work, but each rep shouldn’t be hard. Don’t get psyched up to do your sets. We have found that 2 reps is ideal because any more may cause bicipital tendonitis and if you are doing 12 sets, you are doing 12 first reps per workout. After all, the first rep is the most important one. This will make your contest squat much better. Our most talented lifters will do best on their first rep and then tire quickly whereas our lower skilled people will do better after the first rep is completed because they use the first rep as a body awareness tool. As they become more skilled, their first rep will be their best.\nI know box squatting is not common, mostly because no one knows how do them. After reading this or watching my squat tape you should be fully aware of the benefits. Many great squatters have done box squats including Marv Phillips, Larry Kidney, Roger Estep, Matt Dimel, and of course George Fern, who did an 853 squat in track shorts in 1970. If box squats didn’t work, we wouldn’t do them. We have 20 lifters who have squatted over 700 lbs. in a meet including a 198 who has done 804. 1 hope this article clears up any misconceptions and leads to great success on the lifting platform.\nLouie Simmons",

The sky was the limit for Angelo, having made an elite total as a teen. But by 1993 he was stuck, not in the clouds but at a 1620 total. While many would die to have a total like that, Angelo knew he had not touched his potential. He would tell us of the big gym lifts, but at meets he did much less, always asking, ‘what happened?’\nI kept telling Angelo what was wrong with his training: training with weights above 90% too long and dropping his special work long before meet time. If special exercises serve a valid purpose, why drop them at the most critical time, close to a meet? All who look at or keep records of training will testify that after 4 or 5 weeks at 90% or more your training goes backward. This is because the central nervous system starts to fail and your coordination diminishes greatly.\nWe convinced Angelo to try the most scientific training and get out of his 3 year rut. Not wanting to speak those terrible words ‘what happened ever again, he came to train at Westside.\nThe first thing we did was start him on box squats, on a slightly below parallel box. At that time his best contest squat was 640, so we had him wave his squat from 320, or 50%, up to 385, or 60%. Twelve sets of 2 reps are used for the 50, 52.5, and 55% weeks, and 10 sets of 2 reps are done at 57.5 and 60%. By doing this, the barbell volume stays constant, but the total volume is waved up and down throughout a 5 week mini-cycle.\nThis waving of the total work volume is achieved with arched back good mornings and by rotating pullthrough’s, reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, back raises, walking lunges, pulling a weight sled, and so forth. When an important meet is coming up, Angelo will push up the abs and increase his reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, both in weight and in volume. The results? A 755 squat in less than 3 years, a 215 pound increase. Not bad for a 640 squatter.\nAngelo uses short rest periods between sets; 45 seconds is best. The squats are done on a slightly below parallel box. He will sit back, not down, until he is sitting fully on the box with his shins past a perpendicular position. This places all the work on the glutes, hamstrings, hips, and abs, and of course lower back. This is impossible to do without a box.\nAngelo’s stance is very wide, somewhat wider than his contest squat, and his feet are pointing straight ahead, not turned out. With the feet straight, it works the hips the best. It is harder to squat down this way but much easier to come up because more muscles can be recruited.\nAngelo’s shoes are Chuck Taylor’s. He had been wearing shoes with a heel, which would throw him forward, causing bad form . The flat shoes fixed that problem for good. You can have million dollar shoes and a 10 cent squat.\nThis workout is designed to build explosive and accelerating strength. Don’t go heavier than the top 60%. Rather, concentrate on more speed. Angelo never takes a heavy box squat. He tests his strength on arched back good mornings: 500 is still the most weight used. Billy Masters uses the same method and, like Angelo, will push up his reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions and ab work, and he invariably squats more than 900.\nAngelo’s bench press was OK at 363 but, like the squat, hadn’t increased for some time. Angelo is certainly built to bench, but he was training too heavy and not addressing his weaknesses. He could not understand why he could triple 325 yet bench only 363. The reason is lack of speed. It’s apparent that he was not producing more than 363 pounds of force, or he would be benching more, right?\nWe had him do his 8 sets of 3 reps with 205. This started his bench going up. In less than 3 years, he made 470 in a full meet with three WPC judges. Right before he did the 470, he had worked his way up to using 245 for 4 sets and 255 for 4 sets. This is about 55% of a one rep max. The key was again speed and the development of explosive strength.\nWe all like to lift heavy, so Angelo followed our lead and tried the floor press, board press, J.M. press, incline press, and heavy dumbbell press on a stability ball. He would rotate one of these every 2 weeks, followed by tricep extensions, delt raises, and a lot of lat and upper back work.\nThis conjugate method of training, a rotating of core exercises every 2 weeks, led to an increase in Angelo’s bench press of 107 pounds in less than 3 years.\nWe always have a secret up our sleeves, and this time it came from Mario Civalleri, a friend from Italy . He works with Yuri Kecchi the Olympic and world champion on the rings in gymnastics. Mario suggested we try a form of ring work. Like the stability ball, the rings are another apparatus that is unstable and that builds stability. We had Angelo do pushups in the rings, with the rings hanging close to the floor and his feet on the floor. As he got better, he would raise his feet until he was doing a handstand pushup. This increases muscle mass and strength. I want to mention Mario because he is an unsung hero, one who has never laid eyes on Westside yet contributed greatly to our success.\nLet’s talk about Angelo’s deadlift, a sore spot, to say the least, at 562. The 562 came with a 705 squat, a 143 pound difference. Angelo has brought his deadlift up to an easy 640, this after a 755 squat. That’s a 115 pound difference. How? With a training system out of the past.\nDon Reinhoundt had a method of training the deadlift in a rack where he would lift a certain weight, let’s say 850, off a pin that held the plates 8 inches off the floor. He would do this 8 weeks away from the meet. Each week he would lower the bar I inch until the meet, and he would then pull it at the meet.\nAngelo did the same thing, but he would lower the bar 1 inch for 2 weeks and then rotate to squatting on a 6 inch box for 2 weeks and then back to the rack pull. Sure enough, he got a big PR – 640 – and an 1865 total with 3 WPC judges in the chairs. Again reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, heavy ab work, and a lot of lat work played a large role in his success.\nHere is a man that was stuck for 3-1/2 years at a 1640 total, who was able to increase to 1865 by using this method of training. I am very proud of Angelo. He is our best all-time lifter with the Schwartz formula. This is just the beginning for Angelo, and this we are sure of.\nLouie Simmons",

Six women have squatted or deadlifted more than 500 pounds. Mariah Liggett, the first woman at Westside, set many world records and won more world championships than any other woman. Other notable women from Westside are Doris Simmons, Laura Dodd, Sue Meany, Deb Sorenson, and Terry Byland. But only one has managed to become the strongest pound-for- pound woman to date – Amy Weisberger.\nBoth Carrie Boudreau and Vanessa Gibson have totaled 1151 at 123 pounds. These totals are the only ones by females that surpass a male USPF Elite total. But on February 20,2000, also lifting in the 123s, Amy made a 450 squat, a 280 bench, and a 450 deadlift to total 1180, a world record. Amazingly, six days later she benched 286 and 292 for two more world records. This reflects the fact that Amy is not only very strong but also very fit.\nHow did Amy total 34 pounds over a male Elite? She uses a scientific approach to lifting. For squatting she employs box squats with Flex bands, which provide overspeed eccentrics and progressive concentrics. This increases not only the squat but also the deadlift.\nThe box squats are done with short rest periods between sets (45 seconds works best), Six sets are done when bands are being used. Eight sets are done when just bar weight is used. During Amy’s mini-cycle, the weights ranged from 205 to 245, plus 40 extra pounds of tension at the bottom and 75 pounds of tension at the top with the bands. This loading was for 4 weeks. The last 2 weeks was a de-loading phase: the bands remained the same, but the bar weight was reduced to ensure quickness.\nSpecial work played a great role in Amy’s squat. She does sets on the Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 machine 4 times a week, 2 heavy and 2 light. She also does sled work, lots of abs, pull-throughs, and glute/ham raises. No more than three exercises are performed in one workout.\nAt Amy’s level of preparedness, she must switch core exercises each week on max effort day. She does a variety of good mornings – bent back, arched back, combo squat/good morning, straight leg, and thigh-supported (Paul Anderson style) – to really isolate the erectors. Only one of these is done per workout. Amy will alternate a good morning one week with a squat the next week. The squat exercises that she prefers are Safety Squat bar, front squat, Manta Ray, and belt squat. Sometimes she will add chains or bands. This prevents the body from adapting to an exercise by changing the rate of resistance. By squatting with bands, she has increased her deadlift considerably, through leg drive. (Amy deadlifts only once between meets, and she competes twice a year.)\nAfter the core exercise on max effort day, she will repeat the same special work that she did on speed day, 72 hours previously. She will then pick two or three special exercises for glutes, hamstrings, erectors, and lats, but never in the same sequence as on speed day.\nFor the bench press, Amy does speed work on Sunday using 8 triples with 50% of her contest best. Flex bands that contribute about 25 pounds of tension at chest level and 70 pounds at the top are used in 4-week waves. Then she switches to chains for 3 or 4 weeks. Chains are always used before a meet to eliminate the added eccentric work from the bands. After benching, Amy hits triceps very hard, training them longer than the speed benching (about 20 minutes). Lats are next, and delt raises are last. About 20 lifts out of 200 (about 10%) on the bench are done with a slightly heavier weight to check bar speed.\nOn the max effort day for the bench, Amy chooses from a wide variety of special exercises. Her favorites are board press, floor press, incline and decline press with the bar or dumbbells, overhead band press, and carpet press (like board press but with a roll of carpet instead of the boards). After the max effort core exercise she does triceps, lats, and delts.\nFor GPP work, Amy will do a few extra workouts a week with sled dragging to raise her level of physical preparedness.\nAs you can see, men and women train the same at Westside. There is a test we all must pass: it’s the test of time, and Amy certainly has passed that test as no woman has before.\nLouie Simons",

You must plan to obtain certain objectives. Increases in speed, explosive strength, absolute strength, and stamina are equally important.\nIt has been known and discussed in Weightlifting for All Sports by Ajan and Baroga that a greater training result can be obtained over a greater length of time by using special exercises than by doing the classical lifts. Doing the same exercises repeatedly will rapidly decrease your coordination. There are many reasons for this. Our observation is that very few lifters can increase their abilities without special exercises.\nA question that should be addressed is, when handling max lifts, how do you recover? And how do you at the same time increase muscle mass? The conjugate method is the answer. This is a complex method of rotating special exercises that are close in nature, in our case, to the powerlifts. This method also increases special strength qualities and perfects coordination, which will help advance technical skill. First, and most important, is to properly select exercises that address your particular problems. It could be an exercise that will build up a lagging muscle group or a special strength, such as starting, eccentric, or accelerating strength.\nHow do we train heavy continuously? The answer is to pick several special barbell exercises for a particular lift, for example, the deadlift. The good morning is very similar in motion to deadlifting. A conventional deadlifter will, no doubt, bend over. Therefore, bent over good mornings will increase the deadlift. But remember, when doing the good morning, in your brain, you must duplicate the action of your deadlift precisely. It is not so important to raise your good morning as to raise your deadlift by performing the good morning. We do many types of good mornings, for example, with a Safety Squat bar suspended from chains. But remember to use the same body mechanics as you do in the deadlift.\nA popular special exercise for the deadlift is squatting off a very low box. Angelo Berardinelli does his off a 6-inch box. At this depth, Angelo’s back is in a position similar to his sumo deadlift style.\nWe use a Safety Squat bar very often. When raising out of a squat or deadlift, the shoulders must raise first. The 5-inch camber on the Safety Squat bar teaches you to raise the head and shoulders first; otherwise you will buckle over forward. Once again, when using this bar, think about pulling even though you are squatting. To summarize, pick a core lift with a barbell and try to duplicate the same motion of the lift you are trying to increase. Pick four or five core exercises that work for you and rotate one of them every 2 weeks. Do a max single for a 2 or 3-rep max, but no more.\nFor example, you could do bent over good mornings, Safety Squat bar squats, Zercher squats, very low box squats, and then finish with 2 weeks of rack pulls. This represents a 10-week cycle, rotating each of the above exercises in 2-week mini-cycles. It is important that you end with the most productive exercise for you leading into the meet.\nAfter your selection of a core barbell exercise, pick three to five special exercises. Your workout should last less than 60 minutes. Pick a few special exercises and do them very intensely.\nIf your form is good, then your lower back may be holding you back. Again, select four exercises for the lower back, for example, back raises, straight leg deadlifts off a platform, pull-throughs with legs straight, and reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, and rotate them when necessary.\nFor weak hamstrings, do heavy reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, squatting pull-throughs, glute/ham raises, and sled pulling with your hands behind your back or below your knees while holding onto a strap.\nFor weak glutes, do heavy reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, low belt squats, high-rep deadlifts (2 sets of 20 with back arched, glutes pushed out to rear, shoulder-width stance, hands outside shoulder-width: after first rep, drop bar to just below knees, catch and raise as fast as possible for the entire 20 reps), and glute/ham raises.\nIf your abs are weak, do side bends with a cable bar or dumbbell, leg raises, standing lat machine curl-overs, and strict sit-ups.\nAgain, pick one exercise for each muscle group and use it until it becomes ineffective, then switch.\nFor the bench press, you could do board press, floor press, inclines, declines, or rack lockouts for singles. Rotate one of these every 2 weeks. You could also do ultra wide bench presses for a 6-rep max. You could also do three sets to failure with dumbbells, with a 2 minute rest between sets for singles and a 5-6 minute rest for high reps. Then pick some type of triceps extension with a bar or dumbbells, some type of lat work, and raises for the front, side, and rear delts.\nThere are many types of exercises for each muscle group. Just change when one stops working, and your lifts should continue to increase all year long. By training with this system, you can max out every week of the year, while working continuously on speed and building muscle mass. It works for us and it will work for you. It is the most effective form of training we have ever tried, and in the past 36 years Westside lifters have tried them all.\nJust remember, it’s the selection that counts. You must pick a lift or exercise that builds your particular weaknesses. Don’t get caught up in doing an exercise that your friends like but that does little for you. George Halbert has special exercises he uses for his bench. Chuck Vogelpohl does things that no one does, but they help his squat and deadlift. Amy Weisberger does front and overhead squats to help her squat, and on May 9 at the Ohio State Championship she made a 445 national record squat at 123 and an 1125 total, proof that she does well in selecting her special exercises.\nLouie Simmons",

Like the scholar who must utilize many sources of information to achieve a higher level of knowledge, the lifter must incorporate new and more difficult exercises to raise their standards. Many have the theory that to squat, bench, or deadlift more, you simply have to do the three lifts. If it were that simple no one would need special exercises, machines, or systems of training. But we know this is not true.\nBecause lifters have different body types, they may excel at one lift but struggle with another. The great Lamar Gant was the only lifter I have known who held the world record deadlift and bench at the same time. There are men who hold three world records in the deadlift, yet can’t make the top 10 bench list. Their muscles in the upper body are, I’m sure, as strong as anyone’s, but they are limited by body structure, e.g., short torso, long arms. Many of us are affected by this. But is there an answer?\nIn the early 1970s, the Dynamo Club in the former Soviet Union had 70 highly skilled Olympic lifters. They were introduced to a system of 20-45 special exercises that were grouped into 2-4 exercises per work-out and were rotated as often as necessary to make continuous progress They soon found out that as the squat, good morning, back raise, glute/ham raise, or special pulls got stronger, so did their Olympic lifts. When asked about the system, only one lifter was satisfied with the number of special lifts; the rest wanted more to choose from. And so the conjugate system was originated.\nWhen you have a body type that lacks say, the muscles that squat and yet you squat on a regular ba-sis, then a coupling of special exercises for the glutes, hamstrings, hips, and lower back are needed to fortify those areas. These special exercises will en-able you to raise your squat once more.\nThink about it if you read only one book, no matter how many times you read it, you will only learn so much. If you only squat, you will get only so strong because no new stimulus is introduced. This may not happen in the early stages of training, but as you become more advanced, you will need a more strenuous method of training. This training will indeed help your motor potential and help you to perfect your technical skill.\nBefore I present some examples of conjugate training, think about this. How much could you bench press the first time you tried? 200? 300 perhaps? Now how did you achieve that level of strength without ever having benched be-fore? You did it through simplified training such as pushups and pull-ups. Those of you who could bench 300 the first time will never double that amount without doing specialized work to raise your strength, right?\nHere are some ex-amples of the conju-gate method. Glen Chabot bench presses only twice a month. Both times he uses a close-grip style He can do 405 for reps in the low teens. His best single close grip is 635 without a shirt. In be-tween each workout, he rotates heavy dumbbell work on a flat or incline bench or very heavy bodybuilding exercises for lats, delts, pecs, and triceps.\nThis linking of special exercises has given Glen a 705 bench press at 275. Glen does not arch when he benches and has fairly long arms. He realized that he needed a special program to fortify his pressing muscles. This is a simple but very effective training program.\nA more complex system is Kenny Patterson’s. He will do floor press, chain press, board press, incline press, and over-head press, just to name a few, rotating to a different- exercise each max effort day. On the dynamic day, Kenny uses three different grips on the bench press and uses 60% of his no-shirt max for 8 sets of 3 reps. He adds a lot of triceps extensions with dumbbells or the barbell, rows (one-arm, two-arm, chest-supported), pull downs, delt raises, and forearm work. This is a more complex system than Glen’s, but it suits Kenny’s needs. Kenny is a legitimate 700 bencher, having done it several times across the country.\nMike Ruggiera and myself just made 900 squats. It was a 50pound increase for him and a 40-pound increase for me, yet we did not do a single regular squat in between meets. We do box squats on speed days with a large amount of bands and weight. We also use the Re-verse hyper machine and do glute/ham raises, pull-throughs, and abs. I pull a weighted sled before my squat workouts.\nOn max effort day, we do good mornings (five varities), belt squats, speed deadlifts (60% for 6-8 singles), and Safety Power Squat Bar squats to different box heights. Mike also pulled his first 800 deadlift, without having done any conventional squats and no big deadlifts. After squatting he does deadlifts for singles with 60% for speed, and three days later he maxes out on special work: this is the conjugate method.\nTo push up a squat, heavy good mornings or squatting with different bars is done on max effort day. The different bars make squatting very awkward and extremely hard to do, much harder than a regular squat. (The same is true of box squats; they are harder than competition squats.) On max effort day we may do a type of squat on week 1, a good morning on week 2. and a front squat on week 3, each exercise contributing to the next week’s exercise, which in turn will build a bigger squat by strengthen-ing the weaker muscle group and perfecting form.\nThe training is linked together, enabling you to raise your total. For instance, to build the glute and hamstring area, push up your reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions as hard as possible until your progress slows. Move on to pull-throughs for a week or two, until progress in these slows as well. Then go to glute/ham raises, and again push as fast and hard as possible. Then pull a sled walking forward to build the glutes/hamstrings. It is possible to continuously gain strength in any body part by switching special exercises. As the effectiveness of the exercise decreases, switch to another one. By training in this manner, it is possible to raise all types of strength throughout the year.\nOn max effort day the entire volume consists of unidirectional loading. One training workout con-tributes to the next. Keep in mind that if you train a lift at 90% or more for more than 3 weeks, your central nervous system is negatively and your progress will go backward. But by switching exercises each week (for the high-level lifter), you can use 100% and more each week. The sequence of exercises you use does not matter, as long as the load is maximal. The time it takes to do a maximal effort, for example in a low box squat with a Manta Ray, takes at least as long as max deadlift or squat. This is called “time under tension”.\nThe conjugate method also improves SPP (special physical preparedness e.g., speed deadlifts, plyometrics) and GPP (general physical preparedness; e.g., sled drag-ging). This is the most effective method to gain strength continu-ously throughout the year, with no ridiculous off-season. No one can afford to take time off. By maintain-ing the speed work for the three lifts and increasing general wonk (e.g., upper and lower body sled work, lats, abs, and triceps) you won’t go back-ward. There are many methods of training, but by incorporating the conjugate method, you can’t miss.\nPlease click here for the Conjugate System Webinar, One-on-one with Louie Simmons\nLouie Simmons",

Unfortunately, bench shirts provided only a small increase over one’s raw bench record.\nThat was the 1980s. in the late 1990s, shirts became much stronger. As the shirts got better, the bench records started to move up little by little. Working with Inzer Advance Designs, Kenny Patterson helped refine the denim shirt. They developed the radical cut shirt. The records then started going up and up.\nTodd Brock had a 480 bench and was stuck. After wearing an Inzer radical cut shirt, he skyrocketed to 540 in the same weight class.\nThen Phil Guarino had the insight to cut the back of the shirt, making it an opened-back version. What an innovation that was. I helped him warm up at the Bash for Cash, one of Kieran Kidder’s meets, in Daytona, some years ago. After Phil warmed up, he amazed me with a 661. I knew he had a great idea.\nVanessa Schwenker, a 132 pound woman, had a 260 bench. We went to a bench meet and somehow the back of her shirt tore completely. She didn’t have a backup shirt and had to use the torn one. She benched 290, a PR. We felt lucky. When she got back home, she had the shirt sewn back together, but meet after meet she never made more than 260. She eventually retired and it wasn’t until a year later that we realized it was the open backed shirt that increased her bench.\nNow we know that the openbacked shirts are the best. Just look at the big money meets and see what they’re wearing. Looking back I am amazed how Phil mastered that shirt.\nLike a fast race car, these shirts are hard to master. I took Todd for a ride in my 1960 corvette, and it made him sick. At the time, the car went 10.70 seconds in the quarter mile with about 475 horsepower. It seemed faster, but not for long. I got bored and added nitrous to the 355 Chevy. It went 9.40 in the quarter mile with 800hp. Again, that seemed slow to me, so I put a 404 motor and soon made an 8.60 pass. My reflexes were matching the car’s horsepower, now about 1000. You guessed it, I got bored again. So a 598 on nitrous was added. It went 7.90, 175 m.p.h. So what’s the point of all of this? Had I started with a 7.9 car, I would be dead, and Todd would be real sick. My reflexes would not have matched the strength of the car. That same thing happens with lifters. they try shirts much stronger than they are.\nOh yes, and there are people who think the shirt is doing everything. They’re wrong. At Westside we have held the all-time best in the bench at 132,198,220,242,275, and 308 at one time or another. Why don’t the rest of us put on their shirts and bench the same? We were not strong enough. You’ve got to have the right size bait for a particular size fish. The same is true for bench shirts.\nHow do you master a bench shirt? Most lifters don’t know how to use one correctly. Dan Cummings visited from Iowa and trained with Becca Swanson. He stayed a week. His best was 600. On max effort day, I saw him work out, and I felt he was closer to a 700 bench. He disagreed with me. The next workout, we worked with him, and in a span of 45 minutes he made 665. Not bad huh?\nI did a seminar in Tennessee for my good friends Tony Hutson and Brent Tracy. We worked with eight guys and seven got new PR’s. Here’s how we did it, using Brent’s workouts as an example . Brent’s best is 528 at 198. First he warmed up to 315 off his chest. Next, with the 4-board press, he did 365 x 1, 405 x 1,455 x 1 with no shirt. Then he did a 3-board press with his shirt with 495 x 1. Then he did a 2-board press with 515 x 1. Next he did 530 off his chest and then 545 off his chest for a second PR. I know this sound too good to be true, but it’s true. The trick is each time you go to four boards, raise your head and lower the bar as far down your torso as possible. With three boards raise your head and shoulders if necessary in order to touch the board and go even lower down your torso. With two boards, raise your head and start lowering the bar as low as possible by rolling the shoulders up like a sit-up. Each time you go to fewer boards, pull the shirt a little lower off the shoulders. This of course, makes the shirt a bit stronger. As you increase the weight, raise your head and shoulders and keep your eyes on the bar until it touches the chest. This enables you to touch the chest with a lighter weight than thought possible and at the same time lift a lot more weight.\nNow that the secret’s out, we’re all even, right? I just told you how to kick our ass. If you don’t do it, its your problem, fool.\nAt the 2003 Arnold Classic, Fred Boldt (165) warmed up as I just described. He did 405 off his chest, skipped the four boards, put on a shirt, and did 495 on three boards. Then he did 530 on two boards and went on to the stage and did a 540 opener. He did 551 on his second attempt. After Markus Schick made a 567 world record, Fred took 1 kg more and pressed it only to have it turned down for a technicality. Not bad for a 165 who is 5ft 9in tall, benching in front of a crowd of thousands.\nI hope this information helps you break your bench record and have a better understanding of how to use legal equipment.\nLouie Simmons",

Many methods are combined and rotated in the conjugate system. Combining the speed and max effort days, five elements of strength are trained: quickness, explosiveness, speed strength, strength speed, and absolute strength. This is much like a 5-speed transmission. We all know what happens if you miss a gear or take off in wrong gear. Your car doesn’t run very efficiently, and neither will you.\nAt Westside we train with either very light weights or max weights. Very seldom do we use medium weights, in the 80% to low 90% range. We prefer to break new ground, continually trying new records in special squats, pulls, good mornings, or benches. Remember, if you train at 90% or higher for more than 3 weeks you will fail due to fatiguing the central nervous system.\nWe max out each week. How? By switching exercises each week. This is the conjugate method. Exercises can fall into three categories: general, directed, and sports specific.\nGeneral exercises include the Reverse Hyper machine, glute/ham raises, box jumps, inverse curls, lat work, ab work, tricep extensions, hip extensor/flexor work etc.\nDirected exercises include good mornings, belt squats, deadlifts on a box or from a rack, floor press, rack or board press, and dumbbell press.\nSports specific exercises include legal-depth box squats, close grip bench, wide bench, and deadlifting with the opposite style that you normally use (sumo vs conventional).\nAt Westside, all three categories are used each week. They are not done simultaneously. Why? If a specific type of strength is not trained during a three week period, a loss in strength of 10% or greater occurs. This is true for agility, coordination, and even flexibility.\nAs Dr. Zatsiorsky states, “why climb three-quarters up the mountain only to go back down and start back over?” he is, of course, referring to the progressive overload system. This system is a dead-end street. It was obsolete 40 years ago. At Westside we get faster, stronger, and more muscular, all year long. Here’s how.\nWestside Barbell is closed to the public. Its members go to meets regularly. Because all 30 members compete, we send about a third of our lifters to a particular meet. This enables some of us to help our teammates.\nI believe our success comes from maxing out on maximum effort day eve if you are not going to a meet. This goes on all year long. Our maximum effort system is much like the Bulgarian model. Regardless of our trainability, we max out. It might not be an all-time record, but it’s all you’re capable of on that day. This means that lifters who are not close to a meet will not get PR’s. The lifters who are approaching a meet should make PR’s although the Bulgarians use primarily six main exercises, we use countless special exercises designed to build the weakness of each lifter in all three lifts. The system we find most effective is the conjugate system: a wide variety of special exercises are constantly rotated to make training more effective and fun. This system allows for a longer lifting career. If you have a longer career in any sport, you will benefit from new technology, such as tracks, balls, ball fields, and in our case supportive gear.\nThe following illustrates how we use various methods in our training.\nLet’s start with the maximum effort bench day, which occurs 72 hours after the speed bench day. This is because 72 hours should separate extreme workouts, and we max out each week. Let’s look at the floor press.\nFloor press can be done with pure weight or with 3-5 sets of chains to accommodate resistance. It can be done with at least three different band tensions. This also accommodates resistance but alters the speed of the bar. The unexpected can happen at a meet. The weight can seem harder or easier than expected. By alternating the amount of band or chain, the bar velocity can change, which happens during each attempt.\nYou can use a regular bench and add weight releasers. This is a pure reactive method. The weight is released on the first rep of each set at the bottom. This causes a contrast effect. The contrast method is one where the weight is different at the bottom compared to the top of the lift. This method can be used with any style of pressing including incline, decline, or seated.\nIn the bench we will lower the bar as fast as possible, than catch it just before it hits the chest and reverse from eccentric to concentric as fast as possible. This ballistic lifting is to be done with speed strength weights of 40-60% while doing your triples. Caution: do not use maximal weights. Although ballistic training is not plyometric, it does ensure a rapid shock loading effect, resulting in a strong myotactic stretch reflex, plus taking advantage of the stored energy of the connective and elastic tissues of the muscle complex during eccentric muscle contraction.\nPower rack training for developing a fast rate of force development can be done with your speed strength sets off pins or from chains by resting the bar at any point from the chest to lockout and then exploding to lockout. Simply relax the muscles, and then contract them concentrically as fast as possible. Remember to relax after each lowering phase for 3-4 seconds to reduce stored energy before doing additional reps. To avoid overtraining, take into account the different rates of adaptation to all training systems.\nBox squatting and floor pressing combine two proven methods of strength development relaxed-overcome-by-dynamic work and static- overcome-by-dynamic work. Both build explosive and absolute strength.\nShock training examples are box jumps and rebounding on special devices. To be explosive, this method is necessary. The most extreme work should be performed the day before max effort day. This is to prevent delayed onset of muscular soreness (DOMS), which occurs 48 hours after intense exercise. DOMS can be avoided by doing small restoration workouts 6-12 hours after one of the four major workouts.\nSmall 20 minute workouts for strength gains in particular muscle groups can also be done, to develop general physical preparedness (GPP) or special physical preparedness (SPP). A small workout can be done for flexibility, agility, or balance also. All lifters should do at least 2- 10 extra workouts per week. This is especially true for drug free lifters to provide some form of restoration.\nThere are many methods of training that are used on both max effort and speed day. It is also very important to change core and special exercises frequently. It is vital also to change bar speed by using bands, chains, weight releasers, heavyweight, and light weight. Monitor your intensity zones properly to ensure, for example, that a 400 pound squatter is doing proportionally the same amount of work as a 900 pound squatter. Remember that just when your body has all the answers, you have to change the questions.\nLouie Simmons",

I called Bud Chamiga in Michigan and asked for several of his books that were translated from Russian. These books contained an abundance of science combined special strength training. These materials helped me realize that lifting was a combination of biometrics, physics, and mathematics, not like I had previously thought. There was no mention of training with 5’s or 3’s.\nI had followed the progressive overload system since my first Olympic lifting meet in 1960. The only period in which I did not compete was from 1966 to 1969, when I was in the army. In 1983 I was going nowhere with my training. I was stronger, but slower. That’s where Bud’s books were invaluable. They described methods of training and organization that I had never heard of before. Furthermore, no one in the United States used these methods until I started writing about them in Powerlifting USA. This article is meant to be a refresher about special methods and means on speed day.\nDynamic Effort Method. On speed day, use sub-maximal weights with maximal speed. This method is used to increase the rate of force development and explosive strength, not to build absolute strength. For squatting: 10-12 sets of 2 reps. For benching: 8-9 sets of 3 reps. For deadlifting: 6-10 sets of 1 rep after squatting.\nContrast and Reactive Method. Weight releasers provide one overload rep on each set. The recommended load on weight releasers is 20% of the barbell load. For example: 400 pounds on the bar, 80 pounds on the weight releasers. Use chain weight on the weight releasers for best results. Bands are a contrast method. We use only Jump Stretch bands. Only higher ranked lifters use bands. For speed strength, 65% of the total weight should be barbell weight and 35% should be bar tension. For strength speed or slow strength, used with maximal weights, 65% of the total weight should come from band tension and 35% should be barbell weight.\nLightened Method. By attaching bands to the top of the power rack or Monolift the total barbell weight can be reduced in the bottom of the lift. The percent reduction can range from 15% to 25%. This method builds your rate of force development by overcoming a load with a medium to heavy concentric movement. Concentric Movement. With the bar suspended by chains or by using power rack pins, simply crawl under the bar and raise it concentrically. Going from a relaxed condition to overcoming a stable load wit h light and medium loads of 50% to 80% will develop a rapid rate of force development. When loads of 90% and above are used, this causes maximal force rather than appearing explosive. It may appear somewhat slow due to the massive external résistance. The second method with 90-100% or more to be used on max effort day.\nDynamic Method. For benching or squatting, 20-24 total lifts are standard on dynamic method day. For benching, use 40-50% of a 1RM with a method of accommodating resistance, i.e. bands or chains. For squatting, use 50- 60% with a method of accommodating resistance. Bands or chains must always be used to greatly reduce the deceleration phase. You can stand up for a long time with a weight at the top of the squat; however with a large bar load made up of mostly band tension, you are being pulled back down, causing a force exceeding gravity.\nMethods to develop a rapid rate of force development after an eccentric phase accompanied by a relaxed phase accompanied by a relaxed phase include box squats, floor presses, and board press. Many former college athletes are very explosive but lack a high level of maximal strength. They are very fast with light weight, but as the load grows to near max, 95% and higher, they slow considerably. This can be corrected by using a higher percentage of band tension- 65% of total bar load. This slows the movement down while developing absolute strength.\nMaximal force is displayed foe 0.3 seconds. This can be prolonged with the use of bands to prevent a quick bar deceleration. The late Dr Mel Siff agreed with this. We have a 63-foot shot-putter that said he has always been quick, with a 363 power clean and a 565 deadlift at 250 pounds body weight. However, he could not budge a 600 deadlift. He has zero quickness there. Speed is relative when compared to the amount of resistance.\nPendulum Wave. On dynamic day, use a 3-week Pendulum wave. For example, for the squat week 1, 50%; week 2 55%; week 3 60%; week 4 back to 50%. Change from bands to chains, add weight releasers, use the lightened method or overcoming a rested load, or change your grip or stance.\nGeneral Physical Preparedness. Rest periods should be 45-60 seconds between sets for explosive and speed work. The muscles should be in an excitable state or slightly fatigued. This will cause an increase in difficulty in training. If this is impossible for you, your GPP through small workouts is low. You can raise your GPP thru small workouts between days and even prior to training. Chuck Vogelpohl and I commonly go heavy on the Reverse Hyper Machine and do abs, lats, and sometimes reversal action workouts before a squat or max effort workout.\nSmall workouts during the week will greatly increase your chances of raising your total. Some of these workouts should be for special strength and some for restoration. This is a must for drug-free lifters. I’ve had many drug free lifters here who have greatly pushed up their lifts by doing extra workouts. It’s ok to be drug-free, but don’t be brain-free. If you don’t do more, you will not make progress. A lot of you dudes played high school football, which included 2-and 3-a day practice sessions. You were drug-free then, so what’s the difference? If these workouts are done systematically, you cannot over train. Remember when your squat was 400? 500? 600? and 700? But now you squat 800. How did you get stronger without doing more work, yet you didn’t over train. You merely raised the amount of work systematically over the years. Simply stated , you raised your GPP .\nMuscle Priority Sets. Train the most underdeveloped muscle groups first or a skill that is lacking.\nVerbal Commands. Always use verbal commands such as “blast it”, “drive it”, “speed”, “squeeze the bar”, “head up”, “sit back”, and so on.\nConjugate Sequence Method. Always rotate special exercises on speed day. The more inquiring you are (extroverted), the more often you must switch exercises and the fewer exercises you need. The hardest thing for some lifters is to change. We combine many methods on speed day to fortify our training. If one used a single method, it would take forever to utilize them all and they would not be nonproductive. No one will ever understand the true definition of strength by only reading a book. You must become strong to recognize a weakness.\nLouie Simmons",

It is true that our training is advanced, but it is also great for beginners. Why start out wrong, or start with a program that will yield only small results? Our stats show that we have developed 62 Elite lifters. Many of those got their start at Westside and became world record holders, for example, Heath, Patterson, Fusner, Dimel, Halbert, Vogelpohl, and many women. It’s true we have many advanced methods–for all ages. It’s also true that I totaled Elite in 5 weight classes, all USPF meets, and never heard of chains, bands, circa-max, pendulum waves, or delayed transformation. But I had the common sense to read and learn. What Chuck Vogelpohl did to make his first Elite total in 1988 is the basis for what he does today.\nBecause the Westside system is mathematical, it is based on a percent of your limit strength. It can be used by a 300 squatter or a 900 squatter. They would both train with the same `!percent`!. They would use a 3-week pendumlum wave. The percents range from 50 to 60%. A 300-pound squatter would use 150-180 pounds on speed day: week 1, 150 for 12 x 2 reps; week 2, 165 for 12 x 2 reps; week 3, 180 for 10 x 2 reps. These weights will ensure correct form. This will build speed strength, a very important element of total strength development, best taught early in the career. Short rests (45 seconds) between sets are used. This is the interval method. The short rest will build general physical preparedness (GPP). It will also build mental toughness. For the novice, it is important to build the weak links in the chain. If this is not addressed at an early stage, poor form or, worse, injuries will occur. This will certainly cut a career short. Much of the training volume should consist of special exercises. If your squat stops making progress, more squatting will not help. You must work the muscle group that is lagging. A novice must have good coaches; notice that I said `!coaches`!, not `!coach`!.\nWhen a lifter reaches a high standard, it does not mean he can coach. At Westside we have many great lifters that rose from nothing to greatness. As I taught the Westside training system to our lifters, they were learning what constitutes good form, what volume to use, and what exercise is best for a particular body type. In essence, I taught them to lift as well as to coach. Every lift is thoroughly coached at Westside. We constantly analyze each other before something becomes a problem. It is important for beginners to learn everything about training. At meets our new lifters all have good form. This is not the case with most beginners at meets. We insist that beginners squat wide and bench close. This ensures that the correct muscle groups are developed. For squatting it’s the posterior chain: hamstrings, glutes, calves, and spinal erectors. Someone with little knowledge will try to build the quads to increase their squat. But this will reduce hip flexion, resulting in difficulty reaching a parallel position in the squat and destroying the lockout in the deadlift to the point where they can’t make the top 100 in the weight class below them. When we bring a new face in, we don’t try to train his squat like Chuck trains today, but rather how he started out, plus chains. We update our training continuously. No longer do we use a 5-week wave, but rather a more efficient 3-week wave. In Chuck’s early stages, he used 50-60% for a 3-week wave.\nFor example, when Chuck’s squat was 600 at a meet, he would do the following: week 1: 50% (300) for 12 sets of 2 reps, 60 sec rest week 2: 55% (330) for 12 sets of 2 reps, 60 sec rest week 3: 60% (360) for 10 sets of 2 reps, 60 sec rest On week 4 Chuck would start over at 50% and repeat the 3-week pendulum wave. As his meet squat increased, his workload would slowly increase. When Chuck could squat 600, his squat volume was 7200 pounds: 300 (50%) for 12 sets of 2 reps = 7200 pounds; 360 (60%) for 10 sets of 2 reps = 7200 pounds. When Chuck’s squat was 700, his volume was 8400 pounds: 350 (50%) for 12 sets of 2 reps = 8400 pounds; 385 for 12 sets of 2 reps for week 2; 420 (60%) for 10 sets of 2 reps = 8400 pounds. It took 1200 pounds of squats to push his squat from 600 to 700. When Chuck made his first 800 squat, the work load looked like this: week 1: 400 for 12 sets of 2 reps = 9600 pounds week 2: 440 for 12 sets of 2 reps to raise volume week 3: 480 for 10 sets of 2 reps = 9600 pounds When training at 50-60%, the work is equal for all. Up to this point, Chuck used 3 sets of 5/8-inch chains placed correctly on the bar (see the Reactive Methods video). As you can see, he slowly raised his squat volume systematically, along with other special exercises: Reverse Hyper, pull-throughs, back raises, abs, lats, sled pulling, etc. Chuck’s extra workouts went from one a week to four over the course of 5 years.\nThe extra workouts raise work capacity and increase flexibility, mobility, general physical preparedness, and special physical preparedness (SPP). A beginner should use chains to accommodate resistance. This builds a strong start to enable one to overcome the additional resistance that the chains provide. Chains will also help eliminate bar deceleration. This program can be used for someone who squats as little as 100 pounds. Remember, it is based on percents of a 1-rep max. Chuck’s squat was 865 when we introduced bands to his training. After a year, his squat jumped to 1000 at 220 pounds, but this was after many years of intense training. It’s simple: Chuck raised his work capacity through box squats, special exercises, and extra workouts and through restoration work. I started Chuck out at the beginning. He was not born squatting 800, but systematically rose to world record status. Someone who does not squat 3 1/2 times body weight should not do the circa-max phase, nor do they need a 3-week delayed transformation phase. At Chuck’s first meet (1986), he totaled around 1600 at a light 220. Today his total is 2319 plus best lifts of 2419 in the same weight class. This is a portrait of training adaptation. Not only is the volume increased but also the training has become much more sophisticated. The form in all lifts is constantly improved. Everyone likes the bench, so let’s look at George Halbert’s history at Westside.\nWe saw George bench in Columbus for 2 years and make zero progress. He was stalled at 475 during this time. We convinced him to join us. Like most beginners, his bench form was terrible. It took a couple of years to correct it, both with technique and exercises. George’s pecs were much stronger than his arms. We changed his arm position and concentrated on his triceps. After 1 year, his bench jumped to 628 as a 275 pounder. He learned from Chuck to watch his diet, came down to 198, and set the world record three times in one meet, ending with a 683. This was done mostly with chains. At first, George was taught a lot of exercises. Later on, he began to teach us, much like Chuck did in the squat and deadlift. I have many books about training adaptation, but at Westside I have watched it as well as participated in it. George started at the lowest level and started over, but correctly this time. Like any beginner, he started doing lots of triceps so they would do their fair share and take the pecs out of the lift. He found out how to push the bar straight up and eliminate pec pulls and shoulder problems. If you follow the writing in `!Powerlifting USA`!, you will see that the training constantly changes year after year. Training has become much more complex, but it’s much easier today than 15 years ago. We have eliminated the useless work, and as we have gathered more information, it is much easier to progress.\nThe poundage barriers have fallen: in our gym, 700-pound benches and 1000-pound squats are common. It took George Halbert several years to go from a 500 bench to 700, yet Paul Keyes, a newcomer who trains under George, went from a 585 bench to 750 in an astonishing 51 weeks, and is still progressing. Matt Smith came to Westside with a meager 1800 total. In 4 years, he took that to 2400 by training under our more experienced lifters. Now Matt has totaled over 2500. Matt’s training made it possible for the astounding progress of SHW Tim Harrold. Tim went from 1800 to 2400 in 2 years. What we learned from working with Matt made it possible to take a novice to prominence and at the tender age of 20. This made Tim the youngest to bench 700 and total 2400. I hope those reading this can clearly see that Westside uses an advanced system for the beginner. Why start out wrong? Or why do the same program for years just to total the same numbers? Westside teaches (i) correct form, (ii) raising GPP and SPP, (iii) raising work capacity, (iv) how to teach others, (v) knowing when to wear stronger gear, (vi) how to separate different types of training and to know the effect of a particular training load, (vii) finding the proportionate training load that matches your maximum strength, and (viii) how to organize training for an annual goal. We have developed 63 USPF Elites at Westside, many participating in their first meet under Westside’s supervision.\nIf only I had the advantage of starting out under Chuck Vogelpohl or George Halbert or Joe Bayles, Matt Smith, Mike Ruggeira, and so on. In the 1970s it was Tom Paulucci, Doug Heath, Gary Sanger, and Bill Wittaker who helped orchestrate the early Westside system. Then in the early 1980s, I turned to the top former Soviet sports scientists such as V. Zatsiorsky, T. Bumpa, A. Medvedev, P. Komi, N. Ozolin, A. S. Prilepin, R. Roman, and of course Mel Siff, whose `!Supertraining`! manuals have brought much to all of the United States. Even though we have rivals, we can learn from everyone. Bill Crawford has done several seminars for our lifters. Jesse Kellum has offered much to use, and Bill Gillespie has voiced his views on benching several times.\nBeginners should learn form first, then add chains and, later on, bands. There should be no circa-max squatting until you can squat 3 1/2 times body weight. Learn to use light equipment and then graduate to stronger gear. Lift in positive federations or you will be frozen in time, just like they are. There is no reason that a beginner should not start with an advanced system. Everyone sends his son to Bobby Knight’s basketball camp. I’ve seen lots of lifters come and go. Don’t be one of those. Start right and you won’t incur injuries or fail to make progress and be forced to stop lifting.\nLouie Simmons",

This consists of upper and lower back work.\nThe upper back plays a large role in all three lifts. For squatting, the farther back the bar sits, the greater the leverage. Notice that I said back on the back, not down. At Westside we do a lot of upright rows to thicken the traps. We also do inverted flys with dumbbells, and we use a machine called The Hurricane, a multipurpose device for an assortment of exercises. These really add mass to the entire upper back.\nWe also do dumbbell power cleans, sometimes very heavy for low reps. We have a high school discus thrower who does 4 sets of 4 reps in the one arm power snatch with a 100 pound dumbbell. By the way, we don’t do the Olympic lifts.\nRows of all types are done at least three times a week. The guys who only bench do rows just about every workout, which is four times a week. The full powerlifters do even more rows per week. Chest-supported rows are a mainstay. Very heavy weights are used by most. Among the rows that are performed are the old-fashion t-bar rows with different handles, wide-bar and V-handle rows, one-arm rows across the body , regular barbell rows occasionally with bands, and one-arm dumbbells rows.\nChins are great either with weight or without. But to be honest, we don’t do them very often.\nEveryone does lat pull-downs at Westside, but the Westsider with the strongest lats told me pull downs don’t help his lat strength as much as rows.\nThis is the majority of our upper back work. We also do a lot of band work and sled work for the upper back. Also, any time you do overhead pressing you are working the upper back. We do most of our overhead work seated.\nMost articles on deadlifting address upper back work to assist the deadlift. That, of course is good, but the lower back is injured more often than all the other back muscles combined.\nAt Westside we do a lot of 45-degree reverse hyperextensions. This style hits dramatically not only the lower back but also the hamstrings. They are done very heavy on either squat day or max effort day for the squat and deadlift. Six to ten reps are performed. The number of sets depends on your level of physical preparedness. We do 2-6 reps.\nWe do a lot of work on a good morning machine appropriately named the Back Attack. This machine makes the strictest good morning possible. It anchors the feet with rollers and has an ab pad to feet the legs straight. A roller for the upper body makes it comfortable. Of course, we add bands to the weight. With heavy weight we do 6-10 reps.\nWe have been using the Reverse Hyper machine since 1975. It builds not only the lower back, but also the hamstrings and glutes. The real secret of this machine is that it tractions the vertebrae while you use it, so it builds strength and works as restoration at the same time. We do these at least four times a week; twice heavy and twice light. Chuck Vogelpohl and I use the Reverse Hyper machine heavy before and after squatting on Friday mornings. I do them light on Friday evening. This is repeated on Monday, max effort day. On Tuesday evening Eskil Thomasson and I do heavy again because they traction the back so you can do them repeatedly throughout the week. The reps range from 8 to 12 on heavy workouts and 15 to 30 on light workouts.\nZercher squats will build all the squat and deadlift muscles, especially the lower back. This exercise was intended to be done off the floor, but I could do them off the floor only when I was a 181(I did 320 pounds). Bob Burnett reportedly did 390 for 5 reps in 1967 and made a 675 deadlift at 165 pounds. We now do Zercher squats with a strongman rack. They can be done for 1-3 reps. I prefer high reps, 8-12.\nPull-throughs with straight legs really hit the lower back. High reps are best, 10- 20. for more variety stand on a box, or do a semi-squat to activate the hamstrings.\nWe do a lot of rotational exercises on the Land Mine. This is a popular exercise for wrestlers and mixed martial arts fighters. If you don’t have a Land Mine, place the end of a 45- pound bar in a corner, grab the other end (use a handle if possible) and rotate the bar overhead from one hip to the other. For a better workout, superset these with either Reverse Hyper machine , rows, pull- throughs, good mornings, or lower back exercises. This will enable you to rotate the back in four directions and give you and unbelievable pump. This exercise has pushed up our deadlifts at Westside.\nI hope you can see how all this works together with our rack pulls, band pulls, etc. and all the special squats that we do. There are a vast number of back exercises for the upper and lower back that complement the three powerlifts. One of the above exercises could be the difference between success and failure, by constantly rotating exercises, big and small.\nLouie Simmons",

For instance, you may be able to do a quarter squat with 600 lbs, but you may be able to only full squat 400 pounds. We all know through practical experience that while doing a simple curl, at the start of the movement, is very hard, whereas at the finish it is somewhat easier because of changing leverage. This problem was first addressed around 1900 by Max Herz. His solution was the oblong cam, which he patented. Years later, the Nautilus line of exercise equipment tried to solve this age-old problem – in my opinion unsuccessfully.\nOne lifter’s strength will certainly be different from another lifter’s at the same joint angle. Let’s go back to the 1960s and power rack training. A power rack will, in one way, address this problem. For example, let’s say a lifter can deadlift 600 pounds off the floor. Utilizing a power rack, with the weight 2 inches off the floor he can pull, let’s say 625, and 4 inches off the floor, 650. By sitting the weight as high as 8 inches off the floor, he may be able to pull 750. In this manner, we have solved, at least partly, the problem of overloading, or providing adequate resistance as joint angles change.\nHowever, it’s difficult for some to display this new found strength to flow from pin height to pin height. This can be explained by the fact that it is very seldom that one’s body positions the same while pulling off the floor as it is while pulling off the rack. Isokinetics may be a partial solution, by maintaining a constant bar speed. But as with most machines, you must follow the path of the machine which is different from the path of a free weight. The path of a barbell is somewhat unpredictable at times. Another drawback is that prior to the start, as well as the finish, there is no load bearing on the lifter with this type of apparatus OVERLOAD Is there answer to the problem of how to overload or adequately load the body to match the body’s increase in leverage? Yes, there is. While many people call me for advice, others give me advice that I pass along. A gentleman, whose name I don’t remember, related to me some training he had done with chains. This was a few years ago, but we finally got around to using chains in an experiment with Amy Weisberger, a current World Champion, whose best total in 12 weeks went from 975 to 1025 as 123; Vanessa Schwenker, a current national champion. whose total went from 1030 to 1100 in 12 weeks; Tracy Tate, a novice lifter, increased her bench from 180 to 210; Dave Tate, her husband, a 308 with a previous total of 2028, who went from 782 to 830 in the squat, 540 to 585 in the bench, and 705 to 720 in the deadlift, for a total of 2135. After being stuck at 710 on a low box squat for 2 years, he made 765 after 6 workouts. Now with these examples in mind, here’s how we use chains in out training.\nThe chains are 5 feet long, 5/8 link size and 20 lbs each. They can be found at most industrial tool supply companies. For bench pressing, we will attach the chains to the bar so that when the arms are fully extended, half the chain is resting on the floor. After lowering the bar to the chest, all the chain is on the floor. By doing this, the original bar weight is maintained. Let’s go over this again. If you have 300 pounds on the bar plus 80 pounds of chains attached (2 sets of chains), with half the chain already on the floor, that adds up to 340 at the lockout position, but when the bar is lowered, all the chain is on the floor and the total weight on the bar is reduced to the original 300 at chest level. As you press, the weight gradually increases to 340.\nTraining with chains in this manner accomplishes three things. 1) We have maintained our original weight in order to use the correct percentage for explosive training. 2) We have overloaded the top portion of the lift, which normally does not receive sufficient work because of increased body leverage at this position. 3) A neurological response to build explosive strength is developed. This training will train you to drive to the top because you cannot slack off at the top phase as you used to.\nThose who bench press 400 pounds or less should use 40 pounds of chain; those who bench over 500 should use 80 pounds of chain. Those in between should experiment with both amounts and aim for adequate bar speed. Remember, half the chain should rest on the floor when the bar is racked.\nLifters who have a sticking point at or slightly above the knees in the deadlift will also find great benefit from using chains. Attach the chains to the bar with a lightweight chain to adjust where the heavy chain will leave the floor and contribute to the weight on the bar.\nTom Waddle uses 405-455 of regular bar weight on the deadlift bar. To that he will add up to 200 pounds of chain. As he lifts the 405 it gradually turns into 605 as the chains leave the floor.\nThe chains compensate for added leverage near the lockout. If you are weak at the top, this will solve your problem. Also it will develop starting strength. Because the chains make it more difficult to press as the bar ascends, you will instinctively try to accelerate the bar from start to finish.\nThe effects of special training normally occur in 2-4 weeks, but to my surprise, the training effect with chains is immediate. Experiment As an experiment, we loaded the squat bar to 415 and did 2 reps. Next, a set of chains was added. They were attached so that all the chain weight was on the bar at the top, of 455, and half was unloaded at the bottom, or 435. Four additional sets were done, for a total of five with 415 or more. On set 6, two sets of chains were placed on the bar; top weight 495, bottom weight 455. On set 7, three sets of chains were used; top weight 535, bottom weight 475. Set 8, four sets of chains were used: top weight 575, bottom weight 495. Set 9, five sets of chains were used; top weight 615, bottom weight 515. These sets were done with 50 second rest periods. Next, we removed all the chains so the bar was reduced to the original 415. The box, which was already an inch below parallel, was lowered another inch. Four more sets were done. To our surprise, they were more explosive than our first sets with 415.\nAfter 13 sets with 50 second rest periods, we were actually more explosive because of the chains. This immediate benefit is unheard of with conventional training.\nIt is one of the most effective ways to train that I have encountered. The chains will build starting strength and overload the body at the top of all three lifts, where due to added leverage, the muscles receive little work compared to the bottom portion of the lift. At the bottom, the chains work as a lightening device, by enabling one to handle the most weight at any one position of the lift.\nI am passing this Westside Secret on to you in the hopes of helping you reach your goals, no matter what they may be.\nLouie Simmons REFERENCES Book Of Methods - Louie Simmons",

It’s easy to see why. Most federations have a 24-hour weigh-in rule, which is a positive thing for the health of the lifter. It is easy to rehydrate in 24 hours, which results in fewer cramps and muscle pulls and tears. In the old days, it was common for lifters to pass out while squatting or to drop the squat bar because they were dizzy. And, of course, the more you weigh; the more you can squat or bench. In addition, the introduction of power suits, groove briefs, and bench shirts has enabled the lifter to make bigger and bigger lifts.\nBut, what about the deadlift? Does equipment help in this lift? Shawn Coleman said that using a larger deadlift suit helped him get into a better starting position to pull a PR 835 deadlift. So while supportive gear can help the squat and bench, and prolong one’s lifting career, more times than not it can be a hindrance for deadlifting.\nSo, if equipment is of little benefit, what’s the answer when it comes to the deadlift? Training.\nMost litters deadlift too often and too heavy. This has an ill effect on the central nervous system. A better method is to use a variety of exercises that mimic the deadlift or special exercises that develop the individual muscles that are used while deadlifting (the conjugate method). One must build the muscles that start and finish the lift. Also, there must be methods used to develop speed and acceleration; the quicker the bar Is locked out, the less chance for the grip to give out.\nVince Anello, an 821 deadlifter at 198, once told me that anything he did would make his deadlift go up. Bill Starr said that if you want to deadlift more, don’t deadlift. Bill was an excellent Olympic lifter who pulled a 666 national record in 1970, having concentrated on powerlifting for only a short time. Whether they knew it or not, both men were utilizing the conjugate method. This method was devised to develop the muscles and special strengths (starting, accelerating, absolute).\nThe good morning is a valuable exercise in the conjugate method. For deadlifting, the bent over version is the best. Bend at the upper back first and round over while lowering the bar. The legs can be slightly bent to prevent hyperextension of the knee. While doing good mornings, always think about duplicating the motion of a deadlift. Only you, the person doing the good morning, can gauge its effectiveness, (1) by the stress on the spinal erectors, hamstrings or glutes, and hips, and, of course, (2) if your deadlift goes up.\nShawn Coleman did 600 for 5 reps in the good morning prior to his 835 deadlift. If you are doing 600 for 5 reps and your deadlift is 700 pounds, you are just kidding yourself, and you must change your training.\nUse a variety of bars in the good morning: straight, cambered, Safety Power Squat bar. Use a high bar placement and a low bar placement, close and a wide stance, and sometimes do them seated. Bands and chains as well as weight releasers can be used. One to six reps works best. Stockier men should do at least 3 reps to increase muscle tension. Because a max deadlift can take several seconds to complete, the duration of a set of reps in this lift must also be several seconds.\nVarious types of squatting should also be done to increase the deadlift. Michael Brugger of Germany related to me that the Olympic-style squat was his favorite exercise to increase his deadlift of 887. Eddie Coppin of Belgium made an 826 deadlift at a bodyweight of 186. The front squat was a major part of his training. In the early 1970s, George Clark pulled 700 at 181 and just missed 735, the world record held by Vince Anello. George’s main exercise was the hack squat deadlift, with the bar held behind his back. These are three examples of great lifters using a form of the squat to raise their deadlift.\nSquatting with a bar held in various ways will place the stress on the erectors, hips, and glutes; the primary muscles that deadlift. We advise using a group of specialty bars: Buffalo bar, Safety Power Squat bar, Manta Ray, etc. This will teach you to maintain a more upright position, which is conducive to a good deadlift.\nIf you do all deadlifting, it is a matter of time before your deadlift will stall, or even worse, injury will stop all progress. Why? No ones body will equally distribute the work evenly between the lower, mid, and upper back. If the lower back takes the major role in deadlifting, which is most often the case, eventually an injury will occur. But by doing a variety of special exercises for the upper back, the muscles of the entire back are more likely to receive equal work. These exercises include shrugs, lat work, spinal erec-tor work, good mornings, back raises, reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, glute/ham raises, sled work, and pull-throughs.\nWhat about starting and accelerating strength? The best way to develop these strengths is by using Flex bands. By attaching the bands over the bar, the resistance is applied to the bar evenly. The higher the bar is raised, the more resistance applied to the bar. If you are weak at the top, with the bands you will learn to pull faster at the start, so momentum and then acceleration can help carry the bar to lock-out. It you are weak at the start, the bands will teach you to start off the floor faster, because without the fast start, you will not be able to lock out a heavy deadlift. For those who have said this will not build acceleration: one does not use maximum weight with the bands, but rather 60%. More resistance is added to the bar by the bands as you lift the bar. This is called accommodating resistance.\nConcerning contradictory Information on this subject, research in the United States is invariably done in a college environment. It is conducted with students as subjects. These students many times are not avid weight lifters, nor are they of high standard, such as Elite lifters. Nevertheless, conclusions from these studies are put forth as a model for all training, including that used at football and weight lifting facilities.\nThe most usable results are obtained by testing high-skilled athletes. This is what is done at Westside, where only Elite lifters (43 to date) are tested. You must have a qualified trainer to ask the right questions and highly qualified lifters to test to help answer those questions.\nPoor testing also occurs when two different training methods are tested together. This example also points out the misuse of plyometrics. A lifter had tried a program of plyometrics in between deadlift sets. Not only will the plyometrics dampen the central nervous system for the following sets of deadlifts but in fact the deadlifts would also negatively affect the plyometrics. He raised his pull 2.5-kg, an insignificant amount to register a valid training effect. You can’t train plyometrics and the maximal effort method at the same time.\nPlyometrics help the separation phase only, when the bar separates from the floor. But this particular lifter had difficulty above the knee level and locking out. He was also doing rack work above the knee at the same time and sled pulling. These two exercises build the top part of the deadlift, where he would fail. The plyometrics build the start, not where he needed help. In the United States , plyometrics are misused more times than not. They are so draining on the central nervous system that heavy pulls and squats must be decreased or done during the non competing months of the year. In summary, please be careful what you read. Not all conclusions are valid.\nThe abdominal muscles are extremely important in deadlifting. The abs must flex first, before the lower back starts to do its work. Lifters with weak abs and a strong back will invariably hurt their back. When the back flexes first without the abs working as stabilizers, the back is put under great stress. Therefore, you must learn to increase intraabdominal pressure while lifting. This will reduce the risk of a hernia and greatly reduce pressure on the disks.\nThe internal and external obliques play a great role in stabilizing the hips, and they initiate straightening the legs in the deadlift. Years ago, when powerlifters could deadlift more than they squatted, the obliques were often much more developed than they are today. Lifters use to do side presses and one-armed deadlifts to develop the obliques.\nAt Westside, we do most of our ab work standing up, with a lat machine. The abs must flex downward to be effective. Oblique work can also be done standing up. Face away from the lat machine with the strap held behind your neck. Put one toot in front of the other and bend forward, flexing the obliques. This will train the abs correctly.\nYou must do all types of ab work. In addition to standing ab work, leg raises and straight-leg sit-ups are beneficial. Don’t be confused by the way bodybuilders look. Every time I watch one of those fitness shows, some big-time bodybuilder is telling everyone to keep his or her knees bent to take pressure off the low back. I guess sucking in those abs is a bunch of crap, huh. Because if their abs were half as strong as they look, they wouldn’t be worrying about their lower back.\nAlthough a smaller waist will make it easier to deadlift, it must be very strong. One could see John Kuc’s abs, through his super suit from 100 feet away when he made 870 at 242. Bob Peoples taught the best method of using the abs in the deadlift to me. He said It was best to breath into the stomach only, not the chest. This will stabilize and support the lower back, and it does not elongate the spine. The shorter the spine, the better the deadlifter. If you have long legs, a short torso, and long arms, you have the perfect build for deadlifting.\nMore important than the right build is attitude. The deadlift is a tough lift, especially at the conclusion of a long meet. No attitude is “working out” and a killer attitude is “training” — a big difference.\nLouie Simmons",

Not making progress is no fun and sometimes grounds for retirement. Only the strong at heart will continue. But should anyone ever stall out? The answer is no. The problem is if you do the same training, you will get the same results.\nThere are basically four reasons for falling or succeeding: physiological, psychological, technical, and exercise selection.\nLet’s talk about psychological. Don’t have deadbeats hanging around you. Stay in a positive mental state. If your training partner can’t hang, no matter what their age, give them the hook. You must be competitive, even while training. But you also must want your training partner to succeed, so you will be pushed even more.\nOn maximum effort day go until only the top man is left. On dynamic day try to hurt your training partner with short rest periods. To win, you have to put yourself through hell. Have training partners that want to kick your ass all the time (during the workout). Trash talk is always present at Westside. A new lifter at the gym wanted to load my plates for me during one of his first workouts. I asked him if he respected me. He said he did. I said, “If you respect me while we train, Ill boot you out of here.” He got the idea. When I was young, I didn’t want to lose to an old man. Now that I’m an old man, I don’t like to lose to young men. I cop an attitude, and that attitude kept only five men on the TOP 100 list kicking my ass (and I know where they live).\nI will sum up the psychological aspect of training with the words of Dr. Mel Siff and Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, authors of Supertraining. A high degree of performance depends on motivation, to gain certain goals, aggression, concentration, focus, the ability to tolerate pain and cope with anxiety or stress, developing a winning attitude, and raising the ability to manage distractions and to relax.\nWhat about the physiological aspects? This encompasses several aspects of training, such as the development of starting, accelerating, absolute, and special strength. These are primarily developed with barbell training. The correct loading on the dynamic day as well as the maximum effort day is essential.\nThe physiological aspects also include the development of muscle hypertrophy. This can be accomplished with dumbbells, sled work, and the proper use of special exercises such as chins, rows, triceps extensions, and delt raises. Exercises that raise work capacity or general physical preparedness (GPP) are also essential, especially for drug-free lifters. Men such as Bill Gillespie and Sean Culnan are perfect examples.\nTo address the technical aspects of benching, we must determine what is proper bench press form. It has always been thought that you should push the bar back over the face. However, it makes little sense to do so. When a bar moves toward the face, many bad things occur. The delts are placed under great stress, especially the rotators, and no one wants that. Also, the lats are no longer involved in the lift when the bar moves toward the face. The bar should be lowered with the lats, not the arms. Without strong lat involvement, there is little chance that the bar will be placed on the chest correctly. It may land too high or too low. If it is too low, the delts are involved too much. If the bar lands too high, the triceps are involved too much. Strong lats will ensure the bar is placed in the correct position, that is, with the forearms vertical. In this position, an equal amount of delt, pec, and triceps are used in pressing. If you don’t place the bar in the correct position, delt and pec injuries are more likely to occur.\nThe path of the bar in the concentric phase (raising) should be a straight line. This requires the correct use of muscles. When the Clemson University coaching staff wanted to know which are the most important muscle groups for benching, George Halbert told them triceps are first, lats second, upper back third, and delts last. George holds the world record in the 220’s at 657, a world record of 688 in the 242s and a 683 at 227, the heaviest triple bodyweight bench of all time (457 pounds over bodyweight!).\nThe delts are almost always overworked, and the triceps are underworked. You see a lot of delt and pec injuries but not a lot of triceps injuries. This tells me that most lifters don’t train their triceps to the max. When the triceps, upper back, and lats are the strongest muscle groups, the bar will travel in a straight line, making the distance to lockout much shorter. Also, it does not require the arms to rotate outward, which causes injuries to the pecs and rotators.\nExercise selection is crucial. On dynamic day, after doing your 8-10 sets of 3 reps at 60% of a shirtless max, train the triceps first. It is quite common for our guys to do 14-18 sets of triceps extensions. They are done mostly with a straight bar. One frequently used exercise is J.M. presses, for 3-5 reps, working up as heavy as possible. Always try for a new PR. The same applies to straight bar extensions to the chin, forehead, or throat. Heavy dumbbell extensions are also used, 6-10 reps for 6-10 sets. Use short rests be-tween sets, 30 seconds or less. For the bar work 90 seconds is advised.\nFor advanced lifters, such as Phil Guarino, superset light pushdowns or light dumbbells in between bar extensions or J.M. presses. This will greatly increase your GPP and thus your bench press. Phil used this method for 1 year and pushed up his bench from 525 to 633 at 242 and recently made a 661 at 253 bodyweight.\nAlso for the triceps try using Flex bands while benching off five 2 x 6’s. This takes the delts and chest almost completely out of the movement, leaving only the triceps to do the work.\nLats are next. Rows of all kinds are done as well as lat pulldowns with a wide variety of bars. We don’t do many chins, but they are a good way to work the lats also. We do a lot of upper body sled work. This is my personal favorite. We also do a lot of static lat work with the Flex bands by hooking one band around one of the uprights of the power rack and holding the ends of the band so the lats are contracted for a long period of time, about 2-4 minutes. When you become fatigued at one position, change the position by slightly bending or straightening the arms and continue to hold the tension. Remember, when bench pressing, the lats are held statically. The delts rotate and the arms bend, but the lats stay contracted.\nThe sled and bands work perfectly for the upper back as well. Inverted flyes, dumbbell power cleans, and lat pulls to the face can also be done. Choke a set of Flex bands to the top of the power rack, one on each side. Place a bar in the loops. Lie down as if to bench and pull the bar to the chest or belly using various grips. This simulates the action of the lats while benching. Tuck the elbows in tight.\nIt is also important to have strong forearms. I have never seen a strong bencher who doesn’t have large, powerful forearms. The tighter your grip, the easier it is to activate the triceps.\nTo use the biceps fully when benching, imagine you are stretching the bar apart. The first muscle to flex while pushing a bar concentri-cally will be the biceps. This technique of pushing the bar apart is very important and requires that one do external rotator work. This can be done with rubber bands. Older lifters may remember the chest expanders that Bob Hoffman sold. When these were popular, there seemed to be many fewer shoulder Injuries. Could it be that all of that external rotating prevented rotator injuries, which we see so many of today?\nLet’s look back. If your bench press is not progressing, it could be poor form, which could be a result of a lagging muscle group or not knowing how to bench correctly. Don’t merely take someone else’s advice on how to bench, but think for a minute and review what was discussed here.\nOn speed day, speed is what we are after: starting and accelerating as well as reversal strength. Train with 60% of a no-shirt max. This will utilize power production maximally. Do 8-10 sets of 3 reps.\nOn the maximum effort day you must max out on one core exercise, and don’t be afraid to miss. Do a final warm-up with 90%, then try a PR or two. This workout should occur 3 days after speed day.\nOn both days push up your special exercises such as triceps extensions, delt raises, lat work, and forearm work. After the core lift pick three or four exercises, and never work out longer than 60 minutes. Do your triceps first and forearms last.\nIf possible, do a second workout later in the day. This workout should be 20-30 minutes long and should consist of extensions, raises, lat work, and curls. No bar pressing should be done.\nDoes this work? At Westside we hold 3 out of the 12 all-time world records in the bench: 657 at 220 (George), 688 at 242 (George), and 728 at 275 (Kenny Patterson), the last having the greatest bench co-efficient of all time. Eighteen of our lifters bench more than 550 pounds, and two of these are over 40 years old and are 198’s (Jeff Adams and Jerry Schwenker). Seven men bench more than 600 at Westside. Bill Gillespie, strength coach for the Washington Huskies, has gone from 480 to 628 in about 5 years and has passed every drug test he was given. This should be proof that this sys-tem works for anyone, not just those at Westside.\nLouie Simmons",

No matter what you do it won’t increase. What can you do? Well first, let’s find the real problem. It can be several things: form, exercise selection, volume, and the development of special strength, i.e., starting, accelerating, eccentric, concentric, reversal, static, and of course absolute.\nFirst, let’s talk about form, Box squatting is a must. Use a box that is slightly below parallel. Sit fully on the box, keeping all muscles tight, most importantly the abs and the obliques. By releasing only the hip muscles you are going from a relaxed state to a dynamic phase. This is one of the best methods of developing absolute strength as well as explosive strength. Lowering the bar produces a great amount of kinetic energy, which is stored in the body, resulting in reversal strength.\nFor box squatting, the form is the same as regular squatting. Before descending, the glutes must be pushed out to the rear. Because you are going to squat to the rear and not down, this sets up the body for a stretch reflex. Next, push the knees out to the sides. This accomplishes two things: It places much of the stress, or work, on the hips, and it will greatly increase your leverage in the bottom of the squat. By pushing the knees out, you are at least attempting to keep the knee joint in line with the hip joint. In theory, if you can stand up with 1000 pounds while your shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle joints are in line, you could squat to parallel with the same weight if the above joints are kept in line. That is why it is so important to super-arch the back, by keeping the chest up, while in the bottom of a squat.\nIf you correctly push the glutes out first on the descent, then the head will move last. On the ascending phase, the reverse is true. The head must come up first by pushing the head into the traps. It is then natural for the hips and glutes to follow. Also, never push down with the feet when squatting. You must push out to the sides on the eccentric and concentric phases. That’s why we recommend Chuck Taylor shoes. The feet can be pushed out to the sides without the feet rolling over. When sitting on the box, it is possible, and desirable, for the shins to be past perpendicular. This places all the work on the vital squat muscles. This is impossible with regular squatting.\nTrain on a box with 50-60% of your best contest squat. A 500 pound squatter would start at 250 and jump 10 pounds a week for 6 weeks. Now the weight is 300 pounds. On week 7 drop back to 250(50%) and a new wave. This is done for 10 sets of 2 reps for 4 weeks. Then drop to 8 sets. This will keep the bar volume relatively the same. The volume will change dramatically when you start the wave again, adding 3 or 4 special exercises that have not been used for a period of time.\nThe combination of changing special exercises and using short rest periods (about 40 seconds between sets) has proven to be most effective for producing growth hormone. The short rest will cause lactic acid to build up.\nWhen you fight through this discomfort, you will produce the most growth hormone. Also, when you use maximal weights in the same exercise for more than 3 weeks, growth hormone production stops! Wusef Omar, a colleague of the renowned Tudor Bompa, with the help of top exercise physiologists, validated this at York University in Toronto.\nOn the dynamic day, after box squatting, select 2-4 special exercises to improve. Because all the muscles that squat are located in the back of the body, except the abs, select exercises for the spinal erectors, glutes, and hamstrings, such as back raises, reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, pull- throughs, sled dragging, and calf/ham/glute raises.\nThe abs are very important for squatting, and we look at ab training very seriously. Because when you squat or deadlift, you are standing up, we do the majority of our ab work standing up. This is done on the lat machine. Face away from the machine, and pull a triceps rope down to the base of your neck. Hold the ends of the rope against your chest. Now bend over by forcing the abs to flex downward into the hips. This is exactly how the abs are designed to work. The obliques are the most important ab muscles. When you flex a weight off the floor or start out of a heavy squat, it is the lower obliques that initiate the entire upward motion.\nWhat I have been discussing is correct exercise selection. I hope you noticed that I have not included leg extensions and leg press. Leg extensions are a waste. It’s true that they isolate the quads, but the amount of weight is insignificant. Leg press machines are very dangerous in general. They place a tremendous amount of strain on the lower back. A leg curl machine is designed for bodybuilding. While it does build the hamstrings between the knee and hip, bodybuilders use it because it does not build size at the knee or the glute tie-in. It starts with knee extension and ends with hip extension but in a biomechanically unsound fashion. A glute/ ham machine works both the knee and hip extenders simultaneously. As in running and jumping, the quads do very little in squatting. So don’t waste too much of your time on quads.\nFor accommodating resistance, use chains or bands. Weight releasers are useful for building reversal strength.\nI have discussed the speed day, Friday for squats. For the development of absolute strength, we have a max effort day, 3 days later. On this day, we never do regular squats.\nAbout 7 weeks out of 10 we do some kind of good mornings for a 3-rep max. We use special bars: Safety Squat bar, Buffalo bar, bent bars, and a special cambered bar that has a 14 inch camber, which takes the upper back out and makes the mid to lower back work over-time. Two out of 10 workouts are some type of squatting on a variety of boxes, from 8 to 17 inches high and with a variety of bars or with the Manta Ray or front squat harness.Do a 1-3 rep max in these special squats. Switch the core exercises every 2 weeks, again to maintain production of growth hormone. One out of 10 workouts should be some kind of pull for a 1-rep max.\nAfter the core lift, use 2-4 special exercises (glute/ham raise, reverse hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions, pull-throughs). Raise special work for 3 or 4 weeks. This is the correct method to raise volume, with special work, not the classical exercises.\nNote: Close to a meet, work on speed and raise special exercises for the abs, low back, hamstrings, glutes, and hips.\nThis method has produced 22 lifters who have squatted 800 or more, all from a small, private gym. We have had 500 pound squatters progress to 800 in less than 3 years. I’m sure this method will help you too if you think out your training.\nLouie Simmons",

Only a few years later we have eight 600-pound benchers, six of which bench 650 or more, with four others ready to join the club.\nHow did three become eight? Its evolution of training methods. We are constantly searching for better ways. In the early 1990s, we had seven men who could bench 500, including Matt Dimel’s 575. Jesse KeIlum suggested that we do floor presses, board presses, and rack lock-outs. This enabled three of our lifters, all Juniors, to increase to 600.\nLet’s look at the training of Jimmy Ritchie, who recently benched 650. Years ago, Jimmy had benched 500, after about 2 years of training. But, with the lure of fast bikes and women, he left the gym for 6 years. When he left we were training our bench on speed day at 72%. 1 had just made 530 while training with 365 for 8 sets of 3 reps. When Jimmy returned, we had him use 50% of a contest bench or 60% of a shirtless bench max. Within a year, Jimmy benched 600, and that was in a full meet, where he became our 46th Elite lifter. He recently benched 650, as did Rob Fusner. How did they do it?\nLet’s start with the dynamic (speed) day. The weight at chest level is 300 pounds (46%), consisting of 255 pounds on the bar and 45 pounds of tension from Flex bands. The bands contribute an extra 110 pounds at the top to equal 365 (56%). This weight is used for several weeks leading up to a contest. Seven weeks outside a meet, Jimmy adds a second band to the bar. It supplies extra tension only for the last 8 inches at the top. The total weight at the chest must remain 50% of a shirt-asslsted bench press.\nJimmy will lower the bar very fast, almost dropping it, and he catches it 1-3 inches off his chest. This is ballistic bench pressing. He will press it up as fast as possible, keeping the motionless period as short as possible. The time to complete 3 reps is roughly 3 seconds, the same amount of time as max of 650 pounds.\nThe second band is used for 5 weeks. Then a 2-week downloading period must occur: this develops more bar speed. Here, 295 pounds is on the bar with 40 pounds of chains, instead of bands.\nHe will add a small amount of weight to the bar for some of the sets, 20-30 pounds at the most. This addition of weight is done for 10% of all sets throughout the cycle. This is to check bar speed. If a small jump causes you to slow down, use less weight.\nAfter benching, Jimmy hits the triceps. Some of his favorite exercises are the following. Two-arm dumbbell extensions can be done on the floor or on a decline, incline, or flat bench. When done on the floor, the muscle tension can hi released by resting the dumbbell on the floor; this really helps starting strength. Do 8-12 reps. J.M presses are done for a max triple. Straight bar extensions can be done for a 5-rep max. Five-board presses can be done for a 3- or 5-rep max, with 150 pounds of tension added to the bar. Jimmy also does a lot of lat work and finally delt raises and hammer curls.\nLet’s look back at the dynamic day. The ballistic benching is a supermaximal method and is not plyometric. Do not pause. The stretch reflex will last up to 2 seconds. The triceps are the most important muscle; do extensions. The lats are next in importance. They are responsible for placing the bar correctly on the chest. Over developed pecs take over the role of stabilizing the bar, thus resulting in more muscle tears. There is a need for some pec strength, but the lats and triceps must be the strongest. If your elbows turn out when you bench, placing most of the stress on the pecs, your lats are being removed from the lift and a minimax, or sticking point, occurs. This is where you miss the lift or a pec injury occurs. Also work the delts, with raises to the front, side, and rear, and do hammer curls for the forearms.\nOn speed day, use chains for the most part. When the bar is on the chest, all the chain should be on the floor. At lockout, half the chain is off the floor. Do 8-10 triples with your hands inside the power rings on all sets, including touching the smooth part of the bar. Do 20 lifts out of 200 with slightly heavier weight to test the bar speed. Occasionally use bands instead of the chains; bands cannot be used year-round because they are so hard on your body.\nThree days later is the max effort day. Max effort means maxing out (but not in the regular bench press) with 1-3 reps in various exercises. One of Jimmy’s favorite exercises is the floor press with 200 pounds of chain over the bar. He also does regular benches with a set weight of 335 or 365; he will do singles with one chain, then two, and so forth, until he misses. Jimmy will board press with two, three, or four boards with regular weight or with different amounts of band resistance, ranging from 100 to 300 pounds. Dumbbell presses on the stability ball are also done, for 3 sets to failure with heavy weights, 125-175 pounds. Incline, decline, and seated press are other core exer-cises Jimmy rotates. Each week he rotates to a new exercise that suits his purposes. Everyone in the gym may use a different core lift as meet time approaches.\nAfter the core lift, it’s straight to triceps, lats, delis, and hammer curls. The amount of triceps work (volume and intensity) that you will be able to do on this day is always less because of the nature of maxing out: it’s very hard on the triceps.\nWe now have 25 men benching 550 or more who have used this method. Think about this: Jimmy made a 500 bench 7 years ago doing 8 sets of 3 reps with 365. He now benches 650 using 300 pounds for 8 sets of 3 reps. The two keys are this: be explosive on dynamic day and max out on max effort day, which should be three days later. The ones who fail train too heavy or slow on speed day and not heavy enough on max effort day.\nJimmy goes straight to the meet off of this training. He does not work heavier as the meet approaches. This would he a mistake. You will be maxing out each week on this program. There is a process known as time under tension, which means that if you push or pull or squat concentrically and eccentrically in the same amount of time it takes to do the classical lift, you have ac-complished the same thing as the actual lifts, but by using a core exercise such as floor press, rack press, and bench-ing with bands or chains.\nI must congratulate Bob Hicky and Dave Barns, members of the same club, for both making a 700 pound bench press. It was my dream for Westside to do it first, but a dream is sometimes just a dream.\nLouie Simmons",

The problem is how do you achieve it? For me it was a mystery until I discovered a method of training known as the conjugate method. This is done along with the dynamic method with submaximal weights on a second day, 72 hours later. Today we have 35 people who have done at least 500, four who have done over 600, and the youngest person ever to bench 700. Here’s how. Get Your Bench Manual Today! Your variants will appear here Buy Now Speed On Saturday we use the dynamic method. The weight is 50% of your max bench. We do 8-10 sets of 3 reps. It’s best to use three or more grips In a workout. Most of the sets are done with a grip inside the power rings on the bar, that is, with the little finger inside the ring. Using grips inside the rings will aid greatly in triceps and anterior delt development.\nThe reps must be very explosive. Lower the bar quickly, but under control. Lowering contributes to raising, or concentric, strength. Lowering a bar slowly will build muscle mass but not strength. Please, I beg you, stop reading bodybuilding magazines. They have contributed greatly to ruining strength training in the United States . After all, plyometrics is the energy gained by the body dropping and then responding to that dropping with reversal, or explosive, strength.\nThe bar should be pushed back up in a straight line, not back over the face. This requires strong triceps. This path is a shorter distance and requires no shoulder rotation, which is also much safer. The barbell will always seek the strongest muscle group; that’s why most push the bar over the face. Their delts are stronger than their triceps. But it should be the reverse. One sees a lot of shoulder and pec injuries, but seldom do you see a triceps injury. Why? The triceps have never been pushed to their maximum, potential. Train your Triceps After bench pressing, go first to triceps work. Basically 60 total reps are done with dumbbells, broken down into 5 sets of 10 reps or possibly 7 sets of 8 reps. The palms should be facing inward, toward the body, when dumbbells are used for extensions. When a barbell is used, 40 reps should be done, bringing the bar to the forehead, chin or throat. Paul Dicks presses with a regular bar or a Safety Squat Bar can be done.\nWe do a lot of J.M. presses, named after J. M. Blakely: with a close grip, lower the bar to 4-5 inches off the chest above the nipples, hold for a split second, and press back up. This is a very effective exercise.\nAfter triceps, do front raises with a bar, plate, or dumbbells. Heavy weights used. Also do side delts with dumbbells or a cable, rear delts, 4 or 5 sets of lats, a few hammer curls. Do delt and lat work by feel, but continuously do more and heavier weight. This workout is done on Sunday and should last no longer than 1 hour and 10 minutes. Max Out On Wednesday, the workout is called the maximum effort method day. When using a barbell, do singles. Naturally, work up slowly, but always try a new max.\nWe do many exercises on this day that resemble the bench press but are not a regular bench presses. This is known as conjugate training. After doing an exercise with weights over 90% for 3 - 4 weeks, your strength will regress. We train at 100%+ all year long by changing a barbell exercise every 1 or 2 weeks.\nThe major barbell exercises that we perform are as follows. Floor Presses\nLower the bar until the triceps are completely on the floor and relaxed before pressing the bar up. By relaxing the arms you break up the eccentric/concentric chain. This will build explosive strength as well as the bottom part of the bench press. Board Press Board presses will build the middle part of the bench press. Lay two or three 2 x 6’s on your chest, bring the bar down to the boards, and press back up. This is much different from a rack press because the weight is transferred into the chest, shoulders, and arms. When using three boards, use a close grip, with the index finger just touching the smooth part of the bar. With two boards, place your little fingers on the power rings. Rack Lock-Outs We use six pin positions, all at the top. The bar will move 4-5 inches on the top pin and 10-12 inches on the lowest pin. Always use a close grip. Never lower the weight. Instead, press the bar off pins concentrically.\nSteep Incline with a Close Grip\nHere we will do a max single and then drop down to a 5-rep record. This is only done on the incline. Seated Press We do these off pins set at chin level up to 2-3 inches above the head. Again, do singles. Grip width can vary. This exercise is done after one of the other exercises, about 7 out of 10 workouts, for instance, after board or floor press.\nThe following exercises are done for higher reps, for a rep record. When dumbbells are used for incline, decline, floor, seated, or regular presses, after a warm-up, go to a heavy weight, for example, 110’s, and try a rep record. The rep range should be 15-20. This is known as the repetition method. You must go to failure.\nWeighted pushups with the feet higher or lower than the hands are done the same way. Warm up and max out with a 25, 45, or 100 pound plate on your upper back or have a training partner sit on your shoulders facing the same direction. Dumbbells and pushups also act as a hypertrophy aid.\nIllegally wide bench presses, an inch or so outside the power rings, will act as a strength and muscle builder when a 6-rep max is established for a 2-3 week minicycle. Always keep the elbows tucked in. Note: a 6-rep max means the most weight one can get for 6 reps after a warm-up.\nDo one core (above) exercise per week, followed by four or five special exercises, total, for the triceps, delts, upper back, and lats. Always push up your special exercises. Key Notes: Fast lowering, or the eccentric phase, of a bench press will produce momentum that is converted into kinetic energy that aids in raising the bar back to arms length.\nFloor presses, like box squatting, will build explosive strength by overcoming a static position through active, or dynamic, work.\nDon’t pause the bench press in training; this builds mainly static strength. The stretch reflex lasts up to 2 full seconds, much longer than a legal pause. However, do pause when doing floor presses and board presses.\nWhen doing rack presses, remember to press off a prescribed pin setting. This requires you to overcome inertia.\nAs your triceps get stronger, add chains to the bar for bench pressing. Use 5/8 chains that are 5 feet long, looped through a 1/2 chain that is fixed around the Olympic bar sleeve. Half of the 5/8 chain should be resting on the floor to start. When the bar is on the chest, all the chain should be on the floor. At this position, you have your original 55-60% of your 1 rep max on the bar, which is critical. The Process - A General Outline STEP 1- Max Effort\nExecute a maximal effort upper body workout once a week. Change the exercise, grip, accommodating resistance weekly. STEP 2 - Dynamic Effort\nUse 50% of your best raw bench plus 25% accommodating resistance at the top reducing to 10% at the bottom. execute 9 sets of 3 reps changing your grip after every 3 sets. Every 3 weeks change the bar, bench/bench angle, or accommodating resistance. STEP 3 - Accessory Work\nHammer your triceps. Heavy dumbbells, extensions with barbells and dumbbells need to be done. Find a weakness and target your exercise selection to that. STEP 4 - Joint Integrity Dont forget your joints. They need sets of 100 reps in order to develop. At the end of each workout execute at least 100 - 300 of Face pulls, Shoulder Rotation and Tricep Extensions with a red mini band. Yes I did say 100 - 300 reps. Get Your Bench Manual Today!

Although these lifters are going nowhere fast, they choose to use the progressive gradual overload method, going heavier and heavier each week. In most cases they stop making records and are stuck for years. Yet, they still choose not to use a more sophisticated method of training such as that used at Westside and presently used worldwide.\nThese drug-free filters train so heavy that they can’t do the special work that is required to excel at powerlifting. They do most of their training at over 90% of their max, whereas we do most of our training at 60%. Doesn’t this make more sense? A drug-free lifter trains only three, sometimes two times a week. No wonder they get sore. This style of training is similar to a weekend warrior playing basketball.\nA great many major college and NFL football teams train in the same manner as Westside, and guess what? They are drug-free. During spring training, 3-a- day practices are common. That is 15 workouts a week. So why do you think you should train only two or three times a week?\nWe are on the same side folks, so let’s look at a systematic program that will start you making progress again.\nFirst of all, you must be fast and very strong to excel at powerlifting. This requires a training program that is 50% to the development of absolute strength. The workouts must be separated by 72 hours! So, what can you do in between? You can do small workouts, 15-30 minutes per workout.\nLets look at bench pressing first.\nWorkout #1\nLat pull-downs, dumbbell extensions, and side delt raises, and always do ab work.\nWorkout #2\nBarbell rows, 4 sets of dumbbell presses to failure. Use a weight where 15-20 reps can be done. Rotate from flat, incline, decline, and seated press. Also do abs.\nWorkout #3\nThree sets of seated dumbbell power cleans. Use a weight where 20 reps can be done, but with much effort. Also do one-arm dumbbell rows, 2-4 sets, and 2 sets of pushups to failure and abs.\nWorkout #4\nTwo sets of benching for 25 reps. Use a different grip, wide, close, thumb or thumb less, or even reverse. Also do chin-ups, inverted flies, and abs.\nWorkout #5\nOne of our 198s, Sonny Kerschner, had a 410 bench and was stuck. He began doing tricep pushdowns with a pink flex band looped over a door at his house. Using strict form and a moderate tempo, he did 100 total reps 3 times a week. Six months later his bench press was an official 470.\nAll of the above workouts must be brisk, almost nonstop. Not only will this build substantial muscle mass in the precise area you need it, but it will also raise your work capacity.\nAs you can see, there are countless combinations to choose from. Remember to switch often, and always think “what do I need to raise my bench press?”. Then do only that, for 15-30 minutes tops. Start by adding one small workout a week and add a second and so forth when you feel capable. For the squat and deadlift, the same exercises will work for both. It is important to do ab work in every workout. Sometimes abs can be the only muscle group worked.\nWorkout #1\nPull-throughs, leg raises, and dumbbell rows.\nWorkout #2\nReverse hypers®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2, stability ball, and ab work.\nWorkout #3\nPulling a sled from a belt, rows, and standing abs.\nWorkout #4\nPulling a sled from the ankles and lat pull-downs.\nWorkout #5\nGlute/ham raises, weighted leg raises, and dumbbell powercleans.\nWorkout #6\nWalking lunges, side bends, and sit-ups.\nWorkout #7\nFlex band good mornings and chest supported rows.\nWorkout #8\nBox squat with a band looped through your belt and stand through both ends. Don’t remove the band between sets. Then hook a band to the top of a rack and then over your head to do standing abs.\nWorkout #9\nChoke a band around the base of a rack and do seated leg curls. Then do lying leg raises with chains draped over your ankles.\nWorkout #10\nGood mornings with a band looped through your belt, standing in the loops, plus a second band over the neck and under the feet. Note: When using bands, contract the muscles forcefully, and beware – band work is very taxing.\nI have outlined many workouts here. Use 1-3 exercises per workout. Limit the workout time to 30 minutes, including ab work. This time can also be used for flexibility work, which is important but often overlooked.\nThese special workouts are intended to raise the lagging muscle groups we all possess. While working almost nonstop, you will also raise your general physical preparedness (GPP), something else that is often overlooked. For sports other than powerlifting many drills can be used as well. Agility, flexibility, and dexterity can also be improved.\nThere are many lifters who deadlift or squat over 800 and also total 2000 drug- free. So I know it is possible for you to make great progress if you approach training in a more scientific light.\nOne must realize that large muscle groups recuperate in 72 hours and small ones in 24 hours or less. So it is quite possible to train many times a week. Powerlifting, even with the advances in equipment, still is light years behind all other sports. Tracks have been made for sprinting and better poles and pits have been made for pole vaulting. New advances in football equipment – helmets, pads, turf – have evolved. But powerlifters train with the I.Q. of a caveman. The I.P.F. refuses to use a monolift, and lifters are actually lifting in what is called raw or no equipment meets. What gives? We are going backward, not forward. Take advantage of technology and a scientific approach to training and you just might succeed.\nLouie Simmons",

Are you quick with light loads? What about heavy loads? How explosive are you when jumping or bounding? These are just a few very important questions that need to be addressed.\nLet’s look at a device that can do just that. It’s the Tendo velocity measuring device. It measures the speed of a lift in meters per second or the actual wattage produced by an athlete.\nFor sprinting you can determine the quickness of the athlete. Quickness is the ability to perform high-speed movements with no significant external resistance or great energy, meaning simply how fast one reacts to a stimulus. Some drills for sprinting would be one-leg bounding for either stride length or frequency or bounding over hurdles or box jumping or plyometrics. By attaching the Tendo unit to the athlete, the speed being developed can be measured. The Tendo unit can also measure the velocity with which one throws a medicine ball of different weights.\nWhile beginners will gain explosive strength as well as maximal strength from jumping, for the advanced athlete the same exercises will not produce the same results. Barbells must now be incorporated into the training. The Tendo unit can be attached to a bar to measure how fast one can move a light weight for speed strength and near-maximal weights as well. By using a determined amount of rubber bands on the bar, one can regulate the bar speed to simulate explosive speed or even strength speed work. The more bands used, the slower the bar speed becomes, representing near-maximal or maximal loading. If you do not become faster, you will not become stronger. Also, if you do not become stronger, you will cease to become faster. The Tendo unit can determine this.\nWhen the yearly plan calls for a general preparation microcycle or a sport- specific microcycle with different activities or with weights plus jumping, the Tendo unit can help log important data from month to month or year to year. It can help determine how many jumps per set or the total volume of jumps for the optimal jump loading. This could provide valuable information to the coach and athlete.\nThe Tendo unit can regulate the intensity zone at which an athlete can best perform as well as when to wave into a different loading zone. Training is individual. Introverts need a slower pace of exercise, whereas extroverts require more stimulation, meaning more exercises of variable intensity. The Tendo unit could dictate when it’s time to switch exercises.\nMany times exercises are performed in a fatigued state to simulate a contest environment. The Tendo unit could be used to regulate the amount of sets or reps before a decreased training value distorts progress.\nThe Tendo device can be used by hockey players when hitting a regular or heavier puck or to determine what weight is optimal for a baseball player’s bat. It could be used for all types of strength development, not only for vertical but also for lateral movement. A shot-putter can track his or her speed with the Tendo unit with shots ranging from 7 to 12 kg. A hammer thrower can be tested with a short, standard, and long wires to determine his quickness with each. This would tell the coach which types of strength the athlete needs improvement on.\nIn powerlifting or weight lifting, top velocity while lifting weights is essential, especially with the five classical lifts. The amount of weight will determine just how fast the particular load moves. The Tendo unit can measure the speed of any load up to 100% max lifts.\nDoes an individual lifter squat 700 pounds mostly by speed strength or strength speed? This can be determined by doing squats with a high percentage of bands, roughly 65%, with 35% bar weight. This type of squat is very slow, allowing for no momentum. This produces strength speed.\nFor speed strength 40% of the total weight is bar and plates. At the top, bands add 25%, making the top weight 65% of a 1RM. At the bottom, the band tension adds 10% to the bar, thereby making the weight at the bottom 50%. The bands accommodate resistance. They reduce the deceleration phase of the barbell. Remember, any motion that has acceleration also has a deceleration phase.\nWhile pressing, pulling, or squatting, the acceleration of the bar depends on the net force acting on the bar. This changes as external resistance is increased or decreased. With the Tendo unit, the bar velocity can be checked at any bar speed, whether for speed strength, strength speed, or near-maximal weights of 90-97% of a 1RM.\nThe Tendo unit is used primarily to control bar speed for the development of special strengths. As an experiment in the bench, Karen Sizemore, an official 450 bencher, was tested with a variety of weights. Her power output was measured with each weight: Weight (lbs)\nPower output (watts) 45\n270 95\n379 135\n474 145\n453 155\n459 Karen’s normal training weight is 135 for 9 sets of 3 reps. As you can see, 135 pounds resulted in the highest power production. A band was attached to Karen’s bar to add 45 pounds extra at the chest to equal 180 pounds. The bands added an additional 85 pounds at the top to equal 220 at lockout. The Tendo unit proved we were using the correct weight for her speed work.\nWhat if you want to raise a training weight for speed strength? Fred Boldt has made official benches of 450, 480, and 495 at 165 pounds. His bar speed was 68-72 meters/second with 185. We raised his training weight to 195. Fred’s bar velocity remained the same, which produced an official 540 bench at 163 pounds. Without the Tendo unit we could only guess as to what weight to use as his strength is raised. (Fred also used the same band tension as Karen.)\nIt may be surprising to many, but if you look only at Karen’s chart, you can see that weights can be too light or, of course, too heavy to produce much force. The Tendo unit has many applications in sport. Sometimes what appears to be the truth is not.\nAt Westside, we do a lot of lifts in the lightened method to increase speed. In track, the athlete runs down a track inclined 4 degrees or runs while being pulled back by an elastic cord. A rower can row a lighter boat. Throwers can use lighter shots, hammers, or disks. All of these movements can be measured by the Tendo unit. Training is based on a particular sport, but must be controlled individually by the athlete. These are just some applications that the coach or athlete can use to determine optimal training loads to increase progress. It works while doing general, directed, or sport-specific exercises, which highly trained athletes must do year round. The Tendo unit is a great tool for anyone whose goal is to reach the top.\nLouie Simmons",

At that time, they kept track only of the Top 10 and this was with no equipment. In 1973 I made a 1655 total at 181, again with no gear: a 605 squat, a 380 bench, and a 670 deadlift. At the time, 1605 was Elite, but it was later adjusted to 1643. In 1980 at the YMCA Nationals, I made the Top 10 in the bench press with a 480. This was done with no bench shirt. Then with the introduction of power gear, from 4 inch belts to squat and deadlift suits, and of course the bench shirt, through the years, I totaled Elite in five weight classes, from the 181’s to the 275’s. In the 2002 rankings my bench press was sixth at 575 in the 220 weight class.\nHowever, I experienced many setbacks before 2002. I broke my fifth lumbar vertebra in 1973 and again in 1983. I tore my right bicep in the USPF Senior Nationals in 1979. Six months later, I was lucky and won the YMCA Nationals and pulled a 705 deadlift, 33 pounds more than the weight with which I tore my bicep. But, as luck would have it, I tore two small holes in my lower abs and sustained a partial tear of a pelvic tendon (this still bothers me today). I finally made my first 2000 total in 1987 at the YMCA Nationals in Columbus.\nMy left knee had been bothering me for about a year. I had a heavy workload for the next five years. While training for the APF Seniors in Pittsburg, I suffered a complete patella tendon rupture of the left knee. I went in for a second minor surgery 14 weeks later and nearly died from a reaction to the anesthesia. A tracheotomy was performed and chest tubes were inserted after I stopped breathing for 4 minutes. The chest tubes severed nerves in my ribcage, to this day causing severe shoulder pain.\nI was seriously thinking about giving up lifting. But I trained hard and made a 680 below-parallel box squat (there were no Monolifts at the time) with no knee wraps and without the straps up on the suit. Before this, my best squat was 821 at 242.\nMeanwhile, Kenny Patterson benched 728 at 22 years old in 1995 at 275 and was ranked the best pound-for-pound bencher. But in 1997 he still had not broken that record. We were doing a bench workout and I said, “Damn, Kenny, I’ll squat 700 again before you break that bench record.” And he said “Old man, you will never have 700 on you back again.” Well, I can thank Kenny Patterson because he brought me out of retirement at that moment.\nI competed seven times in the next 11 in full meets and some push/pull meets. My best bench was 530 at 242 in 1992. I broke my bench record several times, ending up with 600 pounds (a dream come true for me). I also squatted over 800 in 1997. This was important for me because no one 50 years or older had made a 600 bench. I also squatted 900 and 920 at 52 years and had a 2100 total.\nI was not pleased because, as usual, I could not put my best lifts together, which were at 235 a 920 squat, a 580 bench, and a 710 deadlift. After squatting 810, I recall telling Jesse Kellum that I could do 900. And he said, “Buddy, why don’t you?” So I did. He was a big help, just being himself.\nChuck Vogelpohl also helped me greatly, always pushing me to the limit, along with all my Westside training partners, in addition to ambition, determination, and my powerlifting friends from around the world. But not of this could have happened if powerlifting gear had not evolved to the point where it is today.\nI went from no knee wraps to Ace bandages, then to horse wraps, then the Canadian wraps such as the TP5000 wraps, to today’s best: Frantz, Inzer, Titan, and Crain. They also have their brand of suits and bench shirts. You can choose from polyester, denim, or canvas. Each Federation has their own rules, so take your pick. This is the U. S. of A., and you have the right to lift in any Federation you choose, whether it is drug-tested or non-tested. At Westside we lift primarily in the APF, IPA, and WPO.\nIt’s not the equipment that makes a champion, but rather your mind. There is really no reason for the controversy over power gear. When Fred Boldt came to Westside, he used a poly shirt. It took 3 months for him to master a double denim. In his first meet, he did 450, but within a year he made 540 in the same shirt. Where did the 90 pounds come from? Training. People come to Westside all the time to train and learn, and most walk out the door with an all-time PR.\nDon’t lie, dudes. You all would love to lift more. The simple fact is a lot of lifters can’t master the gear. For bench shirts, Bill Crawford has the golden hand. For canvas squat suits, Ernie Frantz is the man.\nAt Westside we have the greatest collection of benchers. Four men have held the all-time biggest bench in six weight classes, and I believe another will be added soon. Our lifters have evolved right along with the sport. Chuck’s squat of 1025 was done in a two-ply squat suit, in keeping with WPO rules. The bench records were done in two-ply shirts.\nNothing has changed since powerlifting began. Everyone looks for an edge. That’s simply sport. I remember 20 years ago some knee wraps had a rubber lining. Bill Kazmaier had a pair of shoes that were supposed to be worth $1000. In 1979 at the North American Championships in Canada, Fred Hatfield (Dr. Squat) showed up at the equipment check with a pair of knee wraps make of jock strap waist bands. The IPF ref looked at them and said he couldn’t wear them. They were twice as thick as normal wraps. But Fred won the argument and proceeded to break Ron Collins world record squat. He also had the squat rack pulled out of his way instead of walking the weight out. Was he cheating or innovative? Being a lifter, I thought he was innovative. Every lifter should take advantage of people like Dr. Squat who pave the way to bigger numbers.\nIs the use of squat and deadlift bars cheating? No. That’s progress. When people see a boxing match, they want their man to knock out the opponent. Someone told me, you have to have the right size fish. I think equipment is the same.\nDave “Zippy” Tate said he felt that the only regulation on power gear should be for novices, for example, up to a Master total. Then somewhat stronger suits could be used by those between Master and Elite. Only the strongest and the bravest would use unlimited gear. That’s right, I said the bravest. I have seen a lot of lifters stop progressing because they were scared. That’s right, they’re scared and they won’t admit to it, and they hate those who dare to break today’s records.\nLook at what’s happening today. It’s embarrassing what raw lifters are lifting compared to the lifts in the early 1970’s. Remember my 181 total – 1655. Jack Barnes held the top spot at 1745. At this time, Larry Pacifico was doing 1900 at 198. I saw Larry do a 530 bench at 198 in Cincinnati, and 8 weeks later in Dayton he benched 590 at 228. These lifts were done in full meets with a 1 1⁄2 hour weigh-in. But don’t think for one minute that today’s raw lifter would bench over 600 or squat in the 800s just by putting on gear.\nPowerlifting is years behind other sports as far as equipment is concerned, including swimming, track, football, and even bowling. The gear is getting better in every powerlifting federation including the IPF. As race cars go faster, the rules call for more safety equipment to keep the drivers safe. The racing association made recommendations for a better safety belt harness after Dale Earnhardt’s death. But in powerlifting when new innovations come about we’re cheating? This doesn’t make sense. I don’t know a single strong man who complains about better gear.\nIt’s not easy to learn how to use bench shirts and squat suits. Matt, a 275 from Ball State University, had just made a 479 bench P.R., but could not master his new bench shirt. During a visit to Westside, in 45 minutes he made a 530 bench with plenty to spare. His shirt is 100% legal; he just needed to learn how to use it.\nI notice that the people that bad-mouth the top powerlifters are invisible at power meets. I have to attend the APF Nationals, IPF Nationals and the World Cup, and the WPO semifinals and finals at the Arnold Classic, not to mention the WPO Bash for Cash, and I never see these guys. But I know for a fact that the great lifters at these meets would never give them a second look. After all, what have they done?\nUntil the end of time people will seek out a way to win. That’s human nature. Why not use what’s available. Most use computers today, not an ink quill.\nI read a lot and suggest to you a book: 2001, a Sport’s Odyssey by Dr. Judd Biasiotto. It has been advertised in Powerlifting USA. As you know, Dr. Judd is opposed to modern lifting gear, and his opinion on drug use is the same. His goal was to total 1400 at 132. You can read how he used hypnosis, biofeedback, mind control, and just about everything a cybernetics lab can offer. He was a man of positive thinking. See how long his power career lasted. And, oh yes, how that quest for a 1400 total turned out. He eventually squatted 603 at an AD-FPA meet in 1989. If hypnosis works that well, give me two bottles of it. I invite Dr. Judd to Westside to see what modern lifting is like.\nLouie Smmons",

What about the range of intensity. These are issues seldom addressed by today’s lifters. I found out the hard way that the volume at a particular intensity range must be closely adhered to; not only the total number of lifts, but also the number of lifts per set should be calculated. This was brought to my attention by A. S. Prilepin’s research in 1974. His recommendations were as follow. Percent\n# of Reps\n#Lifts Per Workout\nOptimal # per Workout 70%\n3-5\n12-24\n18 80%\n2-4\n10-20\n15 90%\n1-2\n4-10\n7 If the number of lifts deviates significantly from optimal, a de crease in training effect occurs. This information is found in Managing the Training of Weightlifters by Laputin and Oleshko.\nLet’s look at a simple example. The number of lifts are to be performed on one of two training days. The light percents are for the development of explosive, or speed, strength. A few years ago we were using between 50% and 60% of a contest max in the squat. Three lifters used 400 for 12 sets of 2 reps. That equals 9600 pounds of work at 50% of an 800 squat. At 60% the lifts were reduced to 20. It was broken down to 10 sets of 2 reps at 60%. That represents 480 pounds for 10 sets of 2 reps, or 9600 pounds. All three lifters squatted 804.\nA 700 pound squatter would use 350 (50%) for 12 sets of 2 reps, which is 8400 pounds of volume. At 60% 10 sets of 2 reps are done or 420 pounds for 20 lifts, which equals 8400. A 500 pound squatter would use 250 for 12 sets of 2 reps, which equals 6000 pounds of work. At 60% 10 sets of 2 reps are performed or 300 pounds for 20 lifts, which equals 6000 pounds of volume. I hope you can understand how important controlling the number of lifts at a certain intensity can be. The squats were done off a parallel box with 40 pounds of chain at the top.\nOn max effort day, three days later, we use the conjugate method, where core exercises that are similar to the classical lifts are performed. Good mornings of many types, special squat bars, and other apparatus are employed, but we never do a regular squat.\nStart increasing the bar weight after a good warm-up. Do a lift of about 90%, then try a personal record, and maybe one more, and then do your assistance work. If you look at both days, it looks like this: 80 lifts for explosive and speed strength and 12 lifts for strength speed and absolute strength per month. Remember, this represents training only the classic lifts. But it is easy to see a direct correlation between a contest max and volume trained at the correct intensity zones.\nA Very important factor is special exercises. The coach, who is many times the lifter himself, must find any weaknesses, i.e., a lagging muscle group. For squatting or deadlifting, the posterior chain must be developed: hamstrings, glutes, all back muscles, hips. At Westside this means the total work is distributed like this: 40% Special exercises for Strength, 40% Barbell Lifts, and 20% Restoration and Flexibility. This will sometimes amount to 14 workouts per week. Close to contest time we do fewer barbell lifts and raise special work where needed.\nIf your squat is stalled, more squatting won’t help. You may need more back work or more ham/glute work. In the real world, a squat does not distribute the work evenly. If it did, injury would seldom occur. When reaching your highest potential, doing more classical lifts will only disturb good Form.\nThe same holds true for deadlifting, with even less deadlifting being performed. Training with a\nbarbell held in the hands taxes the CNS heavily. This could lead to a negative training result. This is why we complement the deadlift with many variations of squatting and good mornings. Deadlifting is done with no more than 70% and only for singles. The intensity is raised by using short rest periods between sets, about 30 seconds when doing 6-10 total lifts.\nLearn the difference between training and testing the deadlift or squat. Obtain a box squat PR with added bands that represents your contest squat. A low box squat with the Safety Squat bar is a real indicator of absolute strength for squatting and deadlifting. This is done on our max effort day. Remember, if you squat 300 pounds, use 150-180 pounds on a box starting at 50% in a 3-week\nwave and ending at 60%. On weeks I and 2 do 12 sets of 2 reps, while on the third reduce the sets to 10. The bar volume is always the same, 3600, but the total volume increases during the 3 weeks by adjusting to new special exercises. With a little math, regardless what you squat, the volume is customized for your top lift. At the same time, you are perfecting your form, raising your work capacity, and bringing up your lagging muscle groups.\nIn 1995, Zatsiorsky stated three methods of inducing maximal muscle tension.\n• Overcoming maximal resistance that causes maximal or near maximal muscle tension (maximal effort method).\n• Using considerably less than maximal resistance until fatigue causes one to fail (repetition method).\n• Using sub maximal weights accompanied by maximal speed (dynamic method).\nAll three must be monitored at all times during the year. This explanation may seem simple to some, or possibly too complicated for others. The keys to success are as follows:\n• Match volume with correct intensity. Refer to Prilepin’s intensity chart. • Use a max effort day and, 72 hours later, a dynamic method day.\n• Raise work capacity.\nI have often been asked why is a high work capacity so important. If you are in shape, the heavy weights and the high-volume training will have little negative effect on the lifter. If you are physically fragile, the training will affect you mentally as well as physically.\nTo calculate volume on max effort workouts, there are two methods to consider. The first is when the objective is to increase muscle mass in order to move into a higher weight class: 6-8 lifts in the 90% range. The second method is 3 or 4 sets of 2 reps, the second at 90% and then the next one or two a PR. We prefer the second method, from a psychological point of view. Regardless of how close it is to a meet, or right after, try a record. A record is a process of time under tension. That is most important here. How long it takes to complete a max lift must be duplicated with special core exercises such as good mornings or deadlifts.\nFor ball players or Olympic lifters the percent for squatting is 65-80% for dynamic day. The same procedure for max effort is used as explained earlier, because we don’t wear supportive gear on this day.\nFor benching on dynamic day the percent of a meet max with a shirt is roughly 40%, plus chains. If no chains or bands are added, use 50% of a shirtless max. If your max is 300, do 8 sets of 3 reps using 150 pounds. That’s 450 per set, for a total of 3600 pounds of volume. With a 500 max, do 8 sets of 3 reps with 250. That’s 750 per set, times 8 sets equals 6000 pounds of barbell volume. Remember, this is a no-shirt bench. As you can see, regardless of your bench max, the percent and the number of lifts stay the same, but the volume is constantly increasing.\nWe don’t record special exercises volume, but it must be constantly increasing in sets and top weight. Train special exercises in the correct sequence. For the dead-lift and squat, work low back, ham/glutes, abs, in that order. Don’t move on to the next exercise until muscles are thoroughly worked. For the bench, do triceps, lats, upper back, rear and side delts. The most essential muscle group must be the strongest or injuries will occur.\nFor bench max effort work, the same principles apply as for the squat and deadlift. On max effort day, the conjugate method must be used, i.e., using exercises that are mechanically similar to the classical lifts. Rotate to a different exercise each week. This allows you to lift 100% plus each week.\nNone of the above can happen when using the progressive gradual overload system. Please give it up. It just doesn’t add up.\nLouie Simmons",

So far, 16 have squatted over 800, six have squatted over 850, and one has done 1010, Matt Dimel.\nThe system used is a mixture of the dynamic method and the maximum effort method, greatly influenced by the conjugate method, which emphasizes the parts, not the whole. We always raise work capacity through special means consisting of a large array of exercises.\nThe squat is trained with a barbell two times a week. Friday for speed work with a large training volume and with medium intensity (50-60% of a contest squat) done off a box at or slightly below parallel. This is followed by special exercises for the back, hips, hamstrings, and abs. A second workout is on Monday. It is designed for maximum strength, hence the term maximum effort method’. Once again, exercises for the back, hips, hamstrings, and abs are worked after attempting record poundage on an assortment of core exercises.\nAll of our squats are done on a box. There is nothing dangerous about box squatting. When someone writes about the dangers of box squatting, It is apparent to me that the individual was never taught to box squat correctly or never taught at all.\nThe Washington Huskies have had great success with our program for 8 years, yet they would never box squat. I told them that if they came to Westside and learned how to do them, they would always do them. When the coaches returned home, they put their athletes to the test and found that those who could not learn how to squat by regular squatting discovered how to in half an hour by box squatting.\nThis is how: with the feet pointing straight ahead and much wider than shoulder width apart, push the glutes to the rear (always sit back, not down) until you are sitting on the box. Your shins will be past vertical (knee joint more than 90 degrees), something that is impossible with regular squatting because you would fall over backward. However, this position is made possible with the box, thus overloading the most critical squatting muscles. There is absolutely no pressure on the patella tendons by doing this. Note: Dimel came back to do 903 at the 1993 APF Senior Nationals after tearing off both knees; all his training was on boxes.\nWhy does this box style of squatting teach one to squat properly. Because after squatting back so far and releasing the hip and lower oblique muscles, you must first raise the head to raise out of a deep squat. If while descending into a squat, the glutes go back first, then the head must move last. Right? The opposite of this eccentric phase is an concentric contraction, or raising. It only stands to reason that the head must raise first, and the glutes will follow.\nWe see many lifters get bowed over coming up from a squat because they push with their feet first instead of their head. We are trying to raise the bar, so why not push against the bar first?\nStatic work overcome by dynamic action’ builds explosive strength best. This is precisely what a box squat provides. In addition, you are always breaking parallel. One can also train much lighter; 50-60% of a contest max is all that is necessary to make progress if you keep the lifts explosive and accelerate the bar.\nAs always, 20 out of 200 lifts should be above your training weight for any particular workout. This should occur when the percentage reaches 55 or 60%.\nTo clarify, we use a 5 week wave’, starting at 50% for week 1, jumping 2.5% each week until 60% is reached, and then starting over. The graphical representation looks like a wave, thus the name.\nThe box allows one to max out and to determine your new strength level without the aid of contest gear — wraps, straps, and a big psych. There should be two maxes: a test max and a training max. The contest max requires a large crease of adrenaline, thus causing psychological regression of the central nervous system. This is course, why on max effort day we switch a core exercise such as good mornings or a special squat or deadlift every 2 weeks. This enables us to max 52 weeks a year.\nIt is easy to keep track of your current squat max without maxing out in gear. Bob Youngs has gone from a 570 to a 720 squat in 10 months without doing a regular squat in training. Here’s how. Bob made a 500 box squat record. At a meet, he did 590. He later recorded a 540 box and at a meet did 670. For his third meet in training Bob hit 585. At the meet 720 was strong. When Bob does, lets say, 610 off parallel box, we are confident that his meet squat will be up at least 25 pounds, just as his box squat indicates. Some lifters will get a large carryover and some a small carryover, but it should stay consistent with the individual.\nNow lets get to workout. On Friday we do the speed work. For example, for a 600 lb. squatter, start with 50% for 12 sets of 2 reps with 45 seconds rest between sets. Stay with 12 set of 2’s for 3 weeks, jumping 2.5% each week. At 57.5 and 60%, drop the sets to 10; 60% of 600 is 360; 360 X 10 sets of 2 reps = 7200 pounds. This is equal to the total volume of 12 sets of 2 reps with 50%, or 300 X 24 = 7200 pounds.\nWe follow a modification of Verkhoshansky’s method of reaching total volume. As you can see our bar volume stays the same, but as we wave up every week 2.5%, we greatly raise the volume of special exercises until it is highest at the 60% week. Then it dramatically drops down and is raised gradually as the wave is again increased from 50 to 60% over the next 5 weeks.\nThe assistance work is glute ham raises, reverse hypers®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2, pull-throughs, back raises, and a large dose of ab work as well as pulling a weighted sled.\nWith this system an 800 pound squatter can keep his strength where ever he wants. How? If that 800 squatter trains with weight ranging from 375 to 450(50- 60%), he will maintain a 750 pound squat. Then he can push it up in one wave, or about 5 weeks, to a new max.\nWe think the two most important elements of squat training are the separation off the box — explosive strength — and accelerating strength and, second, raising work capacity through special exercises. Remember to try a new box PR every 8-12 weeks. If you fail, ask yourself why. It must be a particular weak muscle group, so increase the work for that muscle group.\nIf you use Weight Releases, this is the day. We suggest adding 10-20% to the bar weight for the eccentric work. Rubber bands or chains can be added as well, or possibly both devices. When using chains, when you are standing up, about 3 links of the chain should be touching the floor so that when you are seated on the below-parallel box about half the chain is unloaded (lying on the floor). Your top weight with chains while sitting on the box will be approximately 62.5%.\nJoe Amato and Dave Tate made squats of 865 and 870, respectively, by using a top weight of 465 plus 160 pounds of chain. When sitting on the box, half of the chain weight (80 pounds) adds to the 465 bar weight, equaling 545 at the bottom, which is 62.5% of 870.\nThe second squat workout day is Monday. It is known as the maximum effort day. This day benefits the deadlift as well as the squat. It consists of maximum squats for 1-3 reps with a Safety Squat Bar, Manta Ray, front squat harness, etc. All squats are done on boxes of different heights: well above parallel (17, 16,15 inches) or well below parallel (10, 9, 8 inches). After maxing out for 2 weeks on a particular squat, we switch to a variety of good mornings, such as arched back with a close or wide stance, bent-over good mornings with a close or wide stance, with legs bent to different degrees, or a combination good morning/squat, which is a favorite. The latter is done by using a shoulder-width stance. Bend over to above parallel to the floor, then round over and sink into a very deep squat, arch, and return to a standing position. Very heavy weights can be used.\nRack deadlifts from two or three positions as well as deadlifts standing on a platform 2-4 inches high are done for a max single. These deadlifts also help us monitor our progress when we try a new record.\nRotate from a squatting or back-arching core exercise every 2 weeks to a bending-over exercise. This would include good mornings and special deadlifts.\nOne needs to use a wide variety of core barbell exercises to identify weaknesses. Special exercises are like football plays or different punches in boxing; one finds one that will crack the defense of your opponent. Then, of course, that play or punch will cease to work and a new play or punch will need to be found. Eventually you can come back to the original play or punch with newfound success.\nOn Monday, maximum effort day, you must max out on a core barbell exercise, followed by 3-5 special exercises similar to the ones done on Friday, the dynamic day.\nThere are two types of maxes: one in a movement (squat, bench, deadlift, snatch, clean and jerk) and one on a muscle. Hamstrings can be maxed with glute/ham raises, pull-throughs, stiff-legged deadlifts, or arched back good mornings. Spinal erectors can be maxed with back raises or reverse hypers®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2, and traps by shrugs or high pulls. Of course, no muscle can be completely isolated, but you can come as close as possible. These exercises are done for 6-12 reps, or sometimes to failure (the repetition method). Each lifter must determine the number of sets for his or her physical preparedness. These exercises must be rotated when they cease to work, that is, when there is no pump or strength gain. All muscle groups must be worked in this manner, known as the conjugate method. This method has proven effective not only for strength gains but also as a means of restoration.\nClose to an important contest, 10-14 days out, we lower the core exercise top weights, but maintain and sometimes increase the special exercise work. Remember, it is the hamstrings, lower back, hips, and abs that do the squatting, not the quads. It is important to know what squats to increase a squat.\nNote: don’t think of heavy and light workouts, think fast and slow. Fast will develop explosive strength and acceleration. Slow, with super max weight (over 100%), will develop max force. They must be trained in two different workouts. Always train the barbell exercise first, then special exercises in a priority system: what needs the most work train first; what needs the least work train last. It is best to divide the workout into two sessions, separated by at least an hour break.\nIf you follow this approach to training, you may be ‘on deck’ while we’re squatting.\nLouie Simmons",

This takes a strong back as well as strong abs.\nAt Westside, we do max effort work for squatting and deadlifting on the same day, Monday. The same muscles work in these two lifts. It saves energy to lump together the special exercises that contribute to both lifts.\nLet’s first talk about the spinal erectors and how to develop them. Good mornings are done 40% of the time. This means 4 out of 10 Mondays. Any variation can be done. Work up to a 3 rep max.\nThe following variations of good mornings can be used: Bent over with legs bent\nPlace the bar on your back in a squat position or slightly lower and bend over, rounding the upper and lower back. It is up to you how far to bend over. A lifter with a small waist will find it easier to bend over farther. This will build the erectors, hamstrings, and glutes by extending the legs and back simultaneously.\nBent over with legs straight\nThese build the erectors and flexibility in the hamstrings. Arched back with legs straight\nThis style will build static strength in the erectors, which contributes to keeping the back arched while squatting or sumo deadlifting. Lower the bar as far as possible without losing the arch.\nPower arched good mornings\nUse a very wide stance, a low bar position, and lean, don’t bend, forward until the bar is in front of the knees. Heavy weights can be employed. This is not a quarter-squat. Remember, the bar must be in front of the knees after leaning forward.\nCombo squat/good morning\nThis one is very important for learning to extend all the squat and deadlift muscles. With a moderate stance and the bar held low on the back, bend forward until the back is close to the parallel to the floor. Then roll the lower back over and descend into a full squat. To stand up, straighten out the legs. This is very effective for building tremendous extension strength, as well as tremendous tightness. You feel like your eyes will pop out when you’re in the bottom.\nSeated good mornings on a box\nSit on a parallel or above-parallel box and bend over. This takes the legs out of the exercise, which is helpful if you are injured or have a large stomach.\nSeated good mornings on a bench\nSit straddling a bench and bend over until your face touches the bench. This is for the lifter with a small waist and good flexibility.\nWe have reviewed seven types of good mornings, but you can also change the strength curve by using the Weight Release device, Flex bands, or chains. You can vary the work by using a lot of weight and little chain or light bar weight and lots of chains or heavy or light eccentric loading with the Weight Release. These combinations are known as the contrast method. Caution: Use of the Flex bands can make one very sore due to the tremendous eccentric overloading from the tension of the bands, causing delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS). This phenomenon occurs with any type of eccentric stress, but especially with the Flex bands.\nNow let’s isolate:\nBack raises or hyperextensions\nThese are done on a special bench where the feet are anchored and the torso is supported while lying face down. Lower the upper body until your head is close to the floor. Then raise up to parallel, but no higher, to avoid hyperextending the back. The reps are 3-8. Work up to a new max set whenever possible. The 1968 Olympic weight lifting champ Waldemar Bazanowski was able to do 225 for 4 reps, so get to work.\nPull-throughs with straight legs\nPull a low pulley cable through your legs while facing away from the machine. Done with the legs straight, this exercise will hit the lower back. Use high reps, sometimes to failure. Done with legs bent, this will work the glutes.\nReverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 extensions\nFor the mid to the very lowest part of the back, the Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 machine is far superior to any back exercise. Not only does it completely work the low back but it will rotate the sacrum. Also, on every rep when the plates are under your face, it opens the disks and allows spinal fluid to enter, thus providing restoration in addition to strength building.\nAbs\nIn my opinion the side bend is the most important exercise for the abs. The obliques not only work as stabilizers but are responsible for hip extension when lifting of the floor or out of the bottom of the squat. You must learn to push the abs out, expanding them against your power belt. Side bends with a dumbbell at a time; bend to the side and return to a standing position.\nSide deadlifts\nSide deadlifts also work the abs/obliques. Stand next to the bar, facing the plates on the right or left end. Lift the barbell and try not to bend to the side. This exercise will build the obliques and stability in the glutes.\nWe prefer to do our side bends with the help of an overhead cable machine. Stand with the lat machine to your side. Using a triceps strap held against the neck, bend away from the machine and do a side bend. There appears to be little stress on the spine using this method.\nStanding situps with lat machine\nHold a tricep strap around the back of the neck with the two ends held against the chest while facing away from the machine. Now bend over as far as possible while pushing out the abs. Most lifters are very weak when first attempting this exercise, but be patient. The weight will go up and so will your squat and deadlift.\nLeg lifts\nLeg Lifts of any kind are good. Start with lying leg lifts with your legs bent. Progress to straight leg lifts. If your shoulders are good, do hanging leg raises. Do them with bent legs until you are strong enough to keep your legs straight. Use weight if possible. The hardest type of leg raise involves lifting your feet up to the bar you are hanging from.\nPlease don’t be confused by bodybuilding magazines. Your hip flexers/extensors and abs must work together. A bent leg sit-up is worthless unless you have a very weak back and stomach.\nThere are many back and ab exercises to choose from. These are just a few. Some will work for certain individuals better than others. That is precisely why you need lots to choose from.\nThe information in our series of articles is the result of experimentation by 43 elite powerlifters we have developed over the years. We have a system that will teach you to teach yourself.\nLouie Simmons",

His training partner, Chris Young, a 242, was doing 1740 when he came here with Mike. In less than 3 years, Chris raised his total to 2000. Both are regulars here, visiting as often as possible.\nI received a call two months be-fore the 1998 WPC Worlds in Aus-tria from Andrew Dexter, from Canada . He wanted to come here to train the last six weeks before the Worlds. Of course, we said yes. If anyone is willing to live in a hotel in a foreign country just to train, we are happy to have them. Andrew had a 1600 total at 198. He was 23 years old. He told us that only two Canadi-ans were USPF Elites. Well, after 6 weeks, he became the third, with a 1747 total and a Junior World title.\nAndrew’s form in the squat was terrible by our standards. He was box squatting, but not sitting back nearly far enough. Nor was he pushing his knees out to the sides, and he would round over. Building up his abs stopped him from rounding over in the squat. To teach him to push his knees out to the sides, we used a verbal reminder on each squat set. We also had him sit on a well-below – parallel box with a flex band wrapped around his legs just above his knees. Then by pushing his knees apart, his hips became stronger and he learned to force his knees apart. This is ad-duction/abduction work, but this will not work on a machine because the hips must be lower than the knees to be effective. Machines are built so the hips are higher than the knees. By doing this and a few other special exercises, Andrew’s squat went from 573 to 633 In 6 weeks.\nAndrew’s bench press was 400 when he arrived here. His triceps needed work, and he had a bad habit of pushing the bar over his face. First we had to fix his bench form. To do this, he had to build the correct muscles. The strongest muscle must be the triceps. A set of thick lats and upper back are next. The delts, espe-cially rear, are next. The chest will take care of itself.\nOn speed day, Andrew would use 205 for 4 sets of 3 reps and 4 sets of 3 reps with 225 plus a set of chains (on all sets). The chains add 20 extra pounds at lock-out. On max effort day, he sometimes did benches with 275 and 1 set of chains for a single, adding another set of chains for a single, and continuing to add chains until he failed. A second special core lift was a 4-board press with 150 pounds of tension from a set of Flex bands. He would work up to a max. He also did steep Inclines, working up to a max. These exercises were done as three minicycles, 2 weeks each. Each core exercise was fol-lowed by triceps work first, lats, up-per back, and then hammer curls. The result was a 440 bench, a 40- pound Increase.\nFor the deadlift, Andrew had been deadlifting every week. He was shocked when we told him not to do any regular deadlifts. It was his best lift, 640, hard but legal.\nAndrew did good mornings for the first minicycle. His best was 360 for 3 reps. He worked up to 365 for 3 reps and thought he was done. But our guys pushed him on to 425 for 3 reps in the bent-over good morning. The atmosphere at Westside is ‘do or die’, and it’s better to die than not to try. It would have taken a year or two for Andrew to reach 425 for 3 reps back home in Canada.\nThe Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 helped tremendously. One hundred pounds was hard for him at first, but in 6 weeks he was doing 225 for 4 sets of 10 reps.\nAlthough his abs looked good, looking good doesn’t cut it. He did all his abs standing up in front of the lat machine. Oblique work was also done in the same fashion.\nHe pulled one time: 315 plus Flex bands. This was 4 weeks before the Worlds. At the meet Andrew pulled a 672 PR. That made it possible for him to total 1747, a 147-pound increase in 6 short weeks. Here is a guy who has good potential, but is not a genetic freak. And he can go back home and continue to make progress.\nJohn “Chester” Stafford moved from Minnesota to train with us at Westside. He is a very talented lifter; he had a 1978 total in the 275s. After 4 months here, he made a 2070 total in Washington , D.C. How? Basically, his problems were much like Andrew’s: poor squat form and weak triceps.\nFor the squat, we had John take his squat stance out as far as possible to build up his hips, and we had him push up the Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 weight. John likes the good morning and all its variations, and he has a very strong back. By building up the correct muscles, his form has greatly im-proved, taking him from a 749 squat to an 800 squat in less than4 months.\nHis bench press was a bit off because of his weak triceps and be-cause he didn’t know how to use a bench shirt. For the triceps, John did J.M. presses for a few weeks for a 3-rep max. When he started to stall on these, he moved to straight bar ex-tensions to the chin for 5 reps. These helped considerably, but as they started to fade, he moved on to two-arm dumbbell extensions for fast sets of 10 reps.\nWe are still teaching John how to use a bench shirt. He would let the shirt blast the weight out of the bot-tom, and then he would try to take over where the shirt left off. By early 1999, we will have taught him to push along with the shirt to the top.\nJohn’s deadlift is pretty good. At his second meet he made 750 in the 275’s. He has very good form and a very strong back. The box squat is bringing up his hip strength so he can lock out that 800 when it comes. Sled work and glute/ham raises have helped too.\nIt doesn’t matter if you visit Westside or move here; progress comes to anyone. With 22 lifters totaling over 2000, 22 with 800+ squats, and 18 with 550+ benches, we have a good experimental base to work from. Anyone can make fast gains if they pay attention to the complex training system we offer.\nBefore he came to Westside, George Halbert’s best bench was 475 for 2 years. After 1 year at Westside he made 628 In the 275’s. He is now the holder of the all-time best bench in the 220’s (657) and 242’s (688).\nBob Youngs went from a 1470 total to 2000 in 2 years.\nTom Rutigliano was stuck at 1570 in the 181’s. He became the WPC World Champ with an 1851 total in 3 short years. Tommy lives in New Jersey.\nTom’s friend John Wardell was stuck in the bench press at418 for an incredible 8 years. After 3 visits in 5 months, he did 501 in the APF Nationals.\nTom Waddle’s best total was 1855 for years. After 6 months at Westside he made 2060 at the 1993 APF Nationals. Tom did 2259 at the 1995 APF Nationals.\nAmy Weisberger came here with a 760 total at 123. She was told that she would never make any more progress. She has now totaled 1125 in the same class.\nPeople come to Westside from around the world. Flavio Danna, from Brazil , visited us for 6 weeks. He had a 352 bench. One year later, he did 484; what a jump! Flavio found, like most visitors, that his triceps were well under par. When he concen-trated on his triceps, upper back, and lats, his form changed considerably. He now pushes the bar in a straight line.\nI am proud to say we have fans all over the world, and we are fans of our fans. We believe that it is just as important to do that first 300 bench as it is the first 600, and that’s the truth. We have two new friends visit-ing from South Africa, Mike Barker and Brett Burchell, both super heavyweights. Brett, at 350 pounds, has a lot of potential in the squat. George Halbert is helping Brett with his bench press, and the morn-ing crew, which I train with, is con-centrating on Brett’s deadlift and squat. On February 27, 1999, we will see how Mike and Brett respond to our methods.\nLouie Simmons",

Louie Simmons Tue Oct 18, 2016 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shopifycloud/shopify/assets/no-image-2048-5e88c1b20e087fb7bbe9a3771824e743c244f437e4f8ba93bbf7b11b53f7824c_720x.gif\" width=\"\" height=\"\" alt=\"\"> Related Topics: Conjugate Method, Exercise Programming, Louie Simmons, Strength Training Methods In the squat, what is too heavy to train with and too light to train with? In Russia , much research revealed that 65-82.5% of a 1 rep max is best to build strength in the squat. They suggest 2-6 reps per set.\nAt Westside Barbell we do sets of 2 for 2 important reasons. One, more than 2 reps tends Cause bicipital tendonitis and shoulder discomfort. This pain is commonly felt while benching but, in fact, comes from squatting. The bar shifts to some degree, causing damage. Having your hands spaced too close on the bar may also be the culprit. Two, in a power meet, we don’t do reps so if we do 12 sets of 2 reps we are getting 12 first reps per workout. If you do 4 sets of six reps, then you get only 4 first reps.\nThe velocity-force curve shows that weights can actually move too fast (weights below 65%) or too slow (weights above 82.5) . By staying within this percent range, we are continuously working with poundages that provide both adequate velocity and force to produce record-breaking squats. The multiset system with submaximal weights is referred to as the dynamic method. It produces maximum explosive force as well as maximum velocity. It is one thing to be quite strong and quite another thing to display it. This is important to sports teams if the weight room is to be compatible with the sport.\nLet me clarify one important aspect of our training. On our squat/deadlift special exercise day we train with a revolving system of exercises that are switched ever 2-4 weeks. We will work up to a top single (100%+) in a particular lift, for example, the box squat 3 inches above parallel with the Safety Squat Bar. After breaking a record or two, we switch to rack pulls. Again breaking records for a 2- 4 week minicycle. We then switch again. By continually revolving special exercises and training at 100%+, we apply max force throughout the cycle. So as you can see, we have a velocity day and a max force day in the same week. This max force day is referred to as the maximum effort day. This enables us to maintain both maximum force and maximum velocity at the same time. We are able to train heavier longer than with any other system. The volume of weights by percent will make you stronger throughout the year.\nWhat’s wrong with the progressive overload system, commonly used in the United States ? Recall what I said about the force-velocity curve. In the early stages of the progressive overload system, the weights are too light, too light even for velocity work. This can be illustrated by throwing a whiffle ball. No matter how hard you throw it, it just doesn’t go very far, as compared to, say, a baseball. The weight of the baseball is more compatible with applying velocity and force. It’s true that muscle hypertrophy is accomplished during this phase, but we are trying to achieve muscle strength, not size.\nAs the weeks continue in the progressive overload system, the weights reach the 65-82.5% range. For a while you are achieving maximum velocity, providing that you are trying to do so. But as the weights grow heavier, the force factor comes into play. Slowly but surely, you lose that all-important factor – velocity.\nSo as you can see, with the progressive overload system, it is impossible to maintain max force and velocity simultaneously. An additional negative effect occurs with progressive overload; you have lowered your volume to the point that it can no longer support the work needed to produce positive results at meet time. You may be at your strongest 2-3 weeks before the meet and fall on your face more times than not when it counts.\nOne must train at 90% and above for maximum muscle recruitment, but this can only be done for a 6 week period before training efficiency decreases dramatically. However, by training the squat with submaximal weights, with maximal velocity, and by rotating exercises that closely resemble the squat on a second day, you can stay within the boundaries of the force-velocity curve.\nWhen you rotate special exercises, such as good mornings, rack pulls, or Manta Ray squats, anxiety and high blood pressure, which accompany the competition and are present when trying heavy training weights in the squat are eliminated. For most, training with heavy weights in the squat can be so stressful that ones adrenaline level drops drastically.\nAnother negative aspect of progressive overload is that you must always drop assistance work at the end of the cycle, even though these are the exercises that made you strong in the first place. When you stop doing special exercises, their effect is lost in a few weeks, sometimes a few days. So, for the most part, they must be maintained as close to the contest time as possible. Large muscle groups recover in roughly 72 hours; small muscles, in 24 hours. We do our heavy squat and deadlift work on Monday. It never has a negative effect on our Friday squat workout. Therefore, there is no reason to reduce the work done on Monday when the contest is, in fact, a day or two later than our regular squat day.\nAs far as deadlifting goes, we seldom do it. But when we do, we do multiple singles with very short rest periods (30 seconds). We start with 60% for 15 singles. During the minicycle the number of lifts decreases as the percentage increases. Use only one weight per workout. The top percent is roughly 85% and the lifts are reduced to 6-8 singles. If you do this type of training, jump about 5% a week. I recommend that only lifters built to deadlift do this cycle. You must be very explosive on each lift.\nFor example, if you pull a max 700 pounds and you are using 70%, or 490, you must exert 700 pounds or more of force when pulling the weight. Yes, with submaximal weight you can exert more force than is actually on the bar. This is not possible when you do a max triple of 670 when your max is 700. If there was a force meter on the bar with 670, it may surprise you that not one rep would equal 700 pounds. This also explains why a particular lifter can perform 2 reps with 800, yet can do only 800 at a contest. His body can maintain 800 pounds of force for a period that allows two reps. But because of the slow bar movement, there is a lack of adequate velocity to lift the additional 30-40 pounds on the bar at the meet.\nBox squatting on squat day works as the velocity day for the deadlift. On deadlift day, we do a combination of max singles and max reps on a variety of exercises, such as four types of good mornings, five types of squats, five methods of pulls, and an array of exercises for the low back and abs. We may also do static work and isokinetic work. Special exercises with special devices allow maximum speed at the beginning of the lift and maximum overload at the top portion.\nLet us review. When using percent training, one can control volume, keeping it constant throughout the yearly cycle. Speed work and maximum weight can be incorporated into the workout, unlike the progressive overload method, where one is sacrificed for the other. A very important aspect is that special exercises can be maintained throughout the yearly cycle, as well as during the time leading up to the contest. Percent training is far less demanding psychologically, reducing anxiety and stress and keeping blood pressure from rising too high. By constantly breaking gym records in special exercises, confidence is built and a sense of well-being is maintained leading up to the contest. A book entitled “Science and Practice of Strength Training” by Vladimir Zatsiorsky may help clarify many of the points discussed here (1-800-747-4457).\nWe qualified 10 lifters for the WPC Worlds by training with these guidelines. We welcome potential world champions to move to the Columbus area and train with us. Interested and qualified lifters should send their resumes to Westside Barbell.\nLouie Simmons",

The following are some issues to consider: Weight gain or loss\nImproving form on competitive lifts or special exercises Raising work capacity and improving general fitness Gaining general training knowledge\nTesting character and courage\nLearning how to use legal equipment The effectiveness of your training is based on all of these considerations.\nIn this part I will discuss testing character and courage, learning how to use legal equipment, and gaining general training knowledge.\nTesting character and courage. I am a huge fan of most sports, but when I watch basketball, I frequently hear the announcer say the player passed up an open shot to another player because he did not have the confidence to shoot the ball himself, or during a football game, the announcer will say that a certain player is a natural leader. So what are the other 10 players? Natural-born followers? I hope not, but who knows? Why can’t the other 10 teammates step up and take over? Angelo Bernardinelli said it best: “They are two types of people, the prey and the predator.” Which are you? And don’t stroke you ego. I watched Angelo try to break the world middleweight squat record for years. He was always close, but was never able to. The record kept going up, from 766 to 771 to 773. Finally at the WPO m in York, PA, in June 2002 he made 777. Now Angelo has that world record, and he dares anyone to take it away from him. The top middleweights this year are all predators.\nWhen I hear someone tell me what place he got in a meet rather than what his numbers were or if he got a personal record, I know his ego will hold him back. The real contest is with yourself. A trophy proves only what you have done, but has no bearing on what will happen next. You must always do better and better. That’s the real world. You can be the greatest powerlifter in the world, but the day you retire, you’re forgotten. If you quit one time, you’re a quitter. You may go for a year or two without progress before coming out of a slump. Training knowledge as well as technology will make it possible to make progress for a very long time if you want to. Powerlifting is a tough sport. No one said it wasn’t.\nAs far as training partners go, if you run with the lame, you will develop a limp. So only train with those who have the same goals as your own. Everyone cannot be a world champ, but we all can be better. At Westside we have many in-house contests, mostly on max effort day. They can happen without notice, and most often, that’s the case. I recall pulling a heavy sled on a Monday a few years ago. I was minding my own business when Chuck Vogelpoh yells out the door, “Get your old ass in here. We’re going to have a deadlift contest off pin 1 in the power rack.” Well, I’m dead tired from pulling the sled, but someone was running their mouth as usual and now I’m being pulled into a contest on something I had not broken a PR in 15 years. But I’, obligated to take part, and somehow I break my record. How? I guess I was so pissed off at those nitwits that the only way I could get even was to get a PR. When I lose, I use my age (54) as an excuse, but if I win, I rub it in. It’s been said, show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser. Thank goodness we have some very bad losers at Westside. If someone refuses to engage in a spontaneous contest, we will throw challenges at him when he least expects it. If someone regularly backs out, we boot him out of the club. We know by experience that if a lifter will not take a challenge in friendly surroundings, he will fall apart in a real meet.\nOur training in general is designed to build confidence year round by doing so many different exercises. WE are always breaking records. Remember, you must raise your mental and emotional limits as well, or you won’t raise your weights. It may take years to learn to focus on training, let alone meets. Some of us are late bloomers, while others start fast but fade just as fast. Many times the brighter star burns out the fastest.\nWestside loves to see successful teams like Donny Thompson’s Maximus team rising fast. The LA Lifting Club is moving up fast as well, thanks to Joe’s pushing and pulling with the help of his wife Nance. And there’s my Finnish friend Sakari Selkainaho, who lifts and coaches his teammates Jarmao, Ano, Miko, and the rest. I love to see teams or individuals gaining momentum to see how the guys at Westside react to it.\nJust remember, if you’re a betting man and two lifters are coming out to squat and one’s psyching up to DMX and the other one is listening to Patsy Cline’s “I Fall to Pieces”, which one are you going to put your money on?\nWhy do some lifters put limitations on themselves? What I’m talking about is all the “world champs” and “world record holders” I talk to every day. Now wait a minute. There’s only one world record in each lifting category and one world champ per weight class. That person holds the biggest total of the present year or of all time in his weight class. Yes, I’m talking to you master and teen lifters.\nYou may think I’m an asshole for saying this, but you are selling yourself short my man. If you get in a fight and you’re a master, do you get to throw the first three punches? Hell no. When there’s a hottie in the lounge, us old guys are always hitting on the young babes. Right? So why limit yourself by age? Just do the best you can, and you are a champ.\nUsing equipment. This is 2002 and it’s time we all think that way. For example, why don’t all federations use monolifts? Or a bar for each event? Not only is it stupid not to do so, it is dangerous.\nDon’t be stuck in the past. If NASCAR kept the same pace as Powerlifting, the cars would be much slower because of tire restrictions and other safety factors. How many times does it take walking out those before disaster strikes someone? Some federations are held together by one or two great lifters. Please don’t get them hurt because your backward thinking has you on the verge of extinction. Just look at your membership totals slipping lower and lower.\nIf there’s only one top 100 list, then make all things equal: suits, shirts, weigh- ins, etc. It’s not the gear, drugs, or equipment that makes the list. But as Vince McMahon says, “It’s the size of your grapefruits.” You are paying card members, so speak up. Take control of your own destiny.\nGaining general training knowledge. I hate to say this, but at Westside we have lifters who don’t even read Powerlifting USA, let alone some of the books I frequently mention, such as those I am about to describe.\nMichael Yessis published The Soviet Sports Review. There was some valuable information in those articles translated from mostly Russian sports scientist in a quarterly magazine. It covered many sports, but was invaluable to me at the time. The first book that made me a believer was The Managing of the Weight Lifter by Laputin and Oleshko. In this book was shown a table that explained how to regulate volume by intensity zones. The writing of Verkhoshansky such as Fundamentals of Special Strength Training in Sports and many more including Supertraining by Mel Siff are valuable books. A highly respected author is A. S. Medvedyev, who wrote A Program of Multi-year Training in Weightlifting. Of course, there are several other highly accomplished authors including P. V. Komi, Thomas Kurz, Tamas Ajan, and Tudor Bompa.\nLazar Baroga’s book Weightlifting Fitness for all sports is a must-read. Zatsiorsky is particularly valuable to anyone who participates in sports or weightlifting. Try Science and Practice of Strength Training for one. I also enjoy Starzynski and Sozanski for information on explosive power training and Pavel Tsatsouline for stretching and ab work. Without these men, who have dedicated their lives to the promotion of sports science used in a practical environment, I would have ended my lifting career in 1983. The results worldwide speak for themselves. I wish I could thank each of these men personally. Thank goodness I have the opportunity to speak with Dr. Siff and participate in a few seminars with him so I can play a small role in the development of others.\nLouie Simmons",

The following are some issues to consider: Weight gain or loss\nImproving form on competitive lifts or special exercises Raising work capacity and improving general fitness Gaining general training knowledge\nTesting character and courage\nLearning how to use legal equipment The effectiveness of your training is based on all of these considerations.\nWeight gain or loss. First, you must be in the correct weight class. If you are 6ft tall and weigh 180 lbs, you need to gain weight. A lifter like this should increase his protein and calorie intake, or he cannot compete with the top 181s of the world.\nTo solve the problem, on max effort day do max 3’s up to max 6’s. This will build extra muscle mass while also building absolute strength. At Westside we recommend doing only a total of four exercises per workout. To gain weight, add two exercises to add muscle mass. When you gain up to the proper weight class, drop back to the original four exercises, not counting abs. As far as food intake, skip the chocolate milk and cookies and learn about proper nutrition. Buy a book or two and read and learn.\nYou have gained too much if your deadlift goes backward. Your waistline will get too big and your hands will get too fat. I know. It happened to me. You must be disciplined. It might take 5 years of hard training to build yourself to the right weight class.\nImproving form. Improving form is a necessity, but it is sometimes difficult. At Westside we have people who are very good in all lifts. To teach a new lifter, we place them in one of our groups. By interacting with that group, they are taught good form through watching and listening. We never criticize, but rather analyze.\nWe always tell the truth to each other and especially to visitors, because many of them don’t have the luxury of great training partners to watch over them.\nSpecial exercises will play a large role in perfecting top form in all three lifts by doing exercises for whatever muscle group is lagging. This in itself will help perfect your form. It only stands to reason if you have a weakness in a muscle group, it can destroy your form. A word of caution: If you are starting out, start out right.\nMatt Dimel always had a triceps problem, but year after year he would gain little by little and his poorest lift, the bench press, would increase. After rupturing both patella tendons, he eventually won the APF Seniors again. His improved bench press helped. A champion will become a champion by becoming better at his worst lift.\nRaising work capacity and general fitness. Why is this so important? First, we all need to work on our weaknesses. Sometimes it is the ability to train at a fast pace. During a workout, your energy level can drop quickly. Some experts say at 45 minutes. Therefore, one must train at a fast pace to ensure the most important work is completed in 45 minutes. This involves lactic acid tolerance training. That is, while training, a pump in the hips and lower back will occur while squatting and doing back work. To think that one must fully rest between sets is old thinking, to say the least. If you do a work task and fully recover and then repeat the same work, you will use the very some muscle fiber. You gain nothing by training this way. But, by enlisting shorter and shorter rest intervals between work sets, i.e., the interval method, the work will be far more intense, involving more muscle fiber. You will find that the last half of you speed sets will be more explosive of all. When lactic acid is produced, so is growth hormone.\nIf you have a high work capacity, a high-volume, high-intensity workout is not as tiring for you, as it would be for someone out of shape. This enables you to train a little heavier and longer and a little faster than your enemies. This requires one to do small, roughly 20-minute, workouts during the week. The workouts are directed toward any particular weakness you have. It could be a muscle group, flexibility, conditioning, and even concentration, through meditation, or restoration, through massage, saunas, ice baths, back adjustments, or even watching films.\nTo raise general fitness to a high degree may take years. A lifter’s goal should be to raise his classification ranking from class 4 to USPF standard Elite. At Westside we have developed 56 Elite lifters, starting out with nothing. Some who have achieved all-time record performances are Chuck Vogelpohl, Kenny Patterson, and Rob Fusner, to mention a few. They continually raised their work capacity. As they became stronger, their ability to recuperate, perfect form, concentrate, and raise volume increased.\nChuck and I do about 14 workouts a week. We will do a couple sets of dumbbell presses to failure or timed sets with some lat and ab work before squatting. We may do sled work and glute/ham raises before a bench workout. You can even do sled work or the Reverse Hyper machine before a squat or deadlift workout with no adverse effects when you are in top condition.\nBy doing a lot of sled work of all types you work capacity will greatly improve. On max effort day the heaviest sled work is performed. It may involve pulling up to six 45-pound plates on a flat steel sled. The sled is pulled in two ways: with the strap hooked to the back of your belt or holding the strap in your hands between your legs with an upright posture and with your arms straight. The amount of weight is reduced throughout the week until possibly a weight of roughly 60 pounds is used. The weight is lowered, but the length of pulling is greater: 600 feet for the heaviest work and up to 2000 feet for light work. For upper body work, I have dragged for 2 miles nonstop.\nI sometimes do a lot of box jumps as a replacement for some of the sled pulling. Light fireman’s carry can also be done. We also throw a medicine ball for a set time, usually 3-15 minutes with a ball weighing 10-40 pounds. Light powercleans are also very beneficial for conditioning. Do them in one of two ways: First, drop to a hang clean and do powercleans with the interval method. A set can be done every 60, 45, or 30 seconds, depending on your level of fitness. A second variety is to add a push jerk or push press with each set. The sets should last 5-20 minutes. This is a tough one. Dumbbells can be done in a very slow fashion, for up to 8 minutes. Use the shortest time, 2 minutes, with the heaviest bells. For example, use 50-pound dumbbells continuously for 5 minutes, keeping track of the reps.\nWalking lunges can also be done. But whatever exercise you do, it should slowly increase in intensity and volume as years pass.\nEase into the work, but always aim to increase the amount of work. The better condition you’re in, the faster your new records will come.\nThere is much to learn if you are to succeed, and it takes time. You must gain mentally, technically, and physically. So be patient; it will come.\nPart 2 will cover gaining training knowledge, testing character and courage and learning how to use equipment.\nLouie Simmons",

One, in particular, is how the heck did the father in The Courtship of Eddie’s Father turn into the Incredible Hulk? Even Vladimir Zatsiorsky, Lazar Baroga, and Alexsei Medvedyev could not help me with this. However, these men have taught me many things, most of all to think.\nAt Westside, we do not specialize in the bench press, yet we have 7 men who have officially done over 600. Our fifth strongest bencher is Jerry Obradovic, with 644.\nOn March 7, at the Arnold Classic, George Halbert benched a world record 657 (298 kg.) weighing 220. George dropped to 220 on October 18, 1997 , and made a 600 pound bench. In 5 months he made 657 by doing special work with bands and chains. On speed day, which is Sunday for us, George does his benches with 335 for 8 sets of 3 reps. This is slightly over 50%. The reps are very explosive; the 3 reps are completed within the same time frame that his max single requires.\nChains or bands are used to accommodate resistance (40-60 pounds of chains, 100-160 pounds of resistance with bands). If one does the power or Olympic lifts with only a barbell, his or her potential to create additional speed or force is limited by the one-dimensional weight on the bar. If one is to do speed work, he or she should use no more than 60% (based on a no-bench shirt record or 55% or your best meet bench with a shirt) for the 8-10 sets of 3 reps. This is for explosiveness, strength, and accel- eration. This is exactly why you must use bands or chains to accommodate- resistance. Without them the bar moves too fast at the top. My data come from not one or two lifters, but 14 men that can bench at least 551 at Westside.\nGeorge knows his minimax, or sticking point, is about 2-3 inches from the top, so after speed work, George hits the triceps first, then delts and lats. George also will do a small amount of lat and triceps work on Monday and Friday.\nOn max effort day, Wednesday, George has a favorite exercise. He will use a bar with a 5 inch camber. He places two 2 x 6’s on his chest. By doing this, the bar descends only 1-1/2 inches below his chest, not the full 5 inches, which would be too stressful for our lifters. He will use Flex bands, which add 160 pounds of tension to the bar. He will either work up to a max single or do 3 sets of 3 reps. His best is 475 for 3 triples. With the Flex bands, it is 635 at the top.\nPlease note that we never use a bench shirt on our speed day or our max effort day.\nThe Flex bands provided added eccentric overload, which not only builds muscle size but also increases reversal, or starting, strength. Because of the added tension, George will use the bands for only 3 weeks because of the additional muscle soreness.\nGeorge also likes to do floor press with chains. Because the bar rack is so close to the floor, the chains are dropped over the sleeve of the bar. George will warm up with the bar and then add chains ; until he has 200 pounds of chain. Then weight is added, and he works up to a max single. His best is 445 plus 200 pounds of chain. George will always go for a new max, and many times he misses. As the chains come off the floor and the weight accumulates at the, top, he sometimes falls at his minimax, or sticking point. He will push as hard and as long as possible at this point, about 3 inches from lockout. By doing this, he is working at his weak point and devoting valuable time to it.\nAt the Arnold Classic when the 298 kg. hit his sticking point, he blew past it to lockout. How? First, by developing a tremendous start and, second, by increasing the bar speed on speed day.\nOn max effort day, the chains develop and teach acceleration merely through trying to outrun the chains. Also, when George misses at his minimax, he is performing functional isometrics in the best possible way. As the chains add to the weight of the bar, we can determine the precise point at which George fails; now we know where his weak point is with a particular weight. Conventional isometrics – that joint-jarring pressing against immovable pins – is unnecessary.\nThe bands work in the same way, but with added eccentric work, from the bands pulling you down. This additional eccentric work also builds muscle mass.\nAfter each workout George will try to increase his triceps work, in volume and weight. The triceps are worked first after the main exercise, the delts second, and the lats and upper back third. Remember, this is done after the dynamic day work on Sunday and after the max effort day work on Wednesday.\nYou must bring up your weaknesses through special work as well as develop special strength such as starting, accelerating, eccentric, and concentric strength. We do primarily slow work on the stability ball. Always try to cover everything.\nLet’s talk about Mickey Tate. At 41, Mickey did a strong 650 at a body weight of 285. He also concentrates on speed work and works the muscles in the same sequence as George, but on max effort day, he does more mini cycles of incline press than, let’s say, floor press. You will have to find what exercise works best for you, and you should use it closest to the competition.\nJerry Obradovic also does a lot of incline work.\nJ.M. Blakely likes to do the same max effort work as George but also does a lot of J. M. presses.\nKenny Patterson, our biggest bencher with 728, does board presses off a 3 inch board the first week, then off a 2 inch board the second week, then floor presses without chains. Every fifth and sixth week, we suggest high-rep work with dumbbells or with a barbell using an ultra-wide grip.\nRob Fusner was our sixth 600 pound bencher. He likes to use extra-wide benches for a max 6 reps. This particular exercise took Billy Master’s bench from 523, where he was stuck for over a year, to 584, which he smoked at the 1997 APF Nationals.\nAt 50 years old, I benched 600 on February 1,5, 1998. 1 like to do 3 sets of heavy (155’s or 125’s) dumbbells to failure on a stability ball. This is commonly known as the repetition method.\nWe will throw in Weight Releases on speed day or max effort day and get a good response for a few weeks and then switch to something else.\nUsing chains, bands, or Weight Releases is known as the contrast method, where the weight is different at different points of the lift. Remember, you must work at all angles of a lift.\nGood equipment is important. This is 1998; don’t get left behind. Learn how to use a shirt. In the, immortal words of the Road Warriors, “if you are going to a knife fight take your guns.’ That is precisely what we do. Don’t let resistance stop you in your tracks; use it to your advantage.\nLouie Simmons",

His bench press was 400 in the 165 pound class and had been stuck there for a year. After training at Westside for 10 months, Fred pushed his official bench up to 495.\nFred trains intelligently. We found his weakest areas and corrected them. First, his form needed work. He would push the bar over his face and miss the lock- out. This was due to a weakness in the triceps and lats. We also noticed that his upper back was weak. Fred had always trained using the progressive overload method. He was fairly strong, but somewhat slow, lacking explosive power. We switched him from a light/heave system to a much more effective system of a dynamic method day followed by a max effort day 72 hours later. This brought his speed up very fast, which is extremely important. Remember that force equals mass times velocity divided by time.\nBefore Fred trained at Westside he was doing triples with 315, then working up to a heavy single. Now his training weight is 185 with two sets of chains, which add 40 pounds at lock-out. This reduces bar deceleration. After 3 weeks, he switches to mini Jump-stretch bands, which add 85 pounds at the top and 40 pounds at the bottom. The bands also add to the eccentric phase, resulting in a greater stretch reflex. This is accomplished through a gathering of energy in the muscle and connective tissue. This is an extreme workout indeed. Fred performs 9 sets of 3 reps with a maximal eccentric overspeed phase and quick recovery phase with maximum acceleration to completion.\nInstead of doing a so-called heavy day, Fred does a maximal effort day using the conjugate method. Fred used to max out each week, going heavier and heavier until he failed, not aware that training with weights above 90% of a 1-rp max for 3 weeks in a row will result in a lack of progress. Now, Fred will switch a core exercise each week and max out with 100+%. This can be done by switching to a new exercise each week. These exercises may include floor press with bands or chains, board press, and overhead band press. Both dynamic and max effort workouts are concluded with first triceps, then lats, upper back and side and rear delts.\nFred used certain key exercises on max effort day. First he used board presses with bands. This exercise raised his bench to 450 (in a meet). Then it stalled out. At the time, Fred could out-board-press me. I knew this shouldn’t be because I made a 575 at the same meet.\nWe had him do straight bar extensions to the throat. A 45 pound bar for 5 reps was hard for him. This was the first key to progress. When he could do 95 pounds for 5 reps, his bench was 480. Now what else could help?\nNest was push-ups. That’s right, simple push ups. I would place a bar in the bottom of a power rack and elevate his feet on a 13-inch box. Raising the foot simulates an incline press and forces blood into the upper body. When the feet are on the floor, push-ups work like a decline. More weight or reps can be performed with the feet on the floor. Fred will try for a rep record with bodyweight only or with a 45 or 100-pound plate on his upper back, with one edge of the plate at the base of his neck. He also has personal records with a 150-pound person and a 200-pound person sitting on his back.\nFred’s new system of training raised his bench press to an official 459, thus making Westside’s record board, which is not that easy.\nWhen push-ups stopped producing results, Fred moved on to dumbbell extensions, two different types. The first is done with the palms facing each other, and the arms are held straight at the beginning of the movement. Then by bending at the elbow, the dumbbells are lowered until one end of the dumbbell touches the delt. Then it is rolled backward until a full stretch is felt in the triceps near the elbows. To start back up the elbows are pulled slightly forward and extended to completion. The second method is to lay the two dumbbells vertically on the chest with the elbows out to the sides as far as possible. This removes the lats from the movement and places most of the work on the part of the triceps that attaches to the elbow. This builds the extension of the elbow and, of course, this is a lot of you lock-out.\nAt Westside, we frequently hear how good Bill Crawford and his guys are at using their bench shirts. After all, he didn’t just break Kenny Patterson’s 275 record, he destroyed it with his latest 760 pounds. One of his tricks is to do board press while wearing his contest shirt. First Andre Henry tried it, on max effort day, and made a 635 off two boards and ten made a 620 regular bench. I was told that Tony Hutson made a 635 on two boards in the gym and then benched 660 at a meet, a 55 pound PR. So Fred tried it. After working up to 495 on two boards, he blasted up 520 with a lot to spare.\nThere is a lot of information out there. Don’t be a fool and look the other way. Guys like Bill Crawford are willing to give back to their fellow lifters, and after all, he is a world record holder. If you are a nobody or a has-been, don’t complain about the modern equipment, but rather learn to use it correctly. Hell, if your psychologist tells you using a bench shirt is cheating, save that $200 an hour and I will buy you a bench shirt, you know, one of those items that is allowed according to the rules.\nFred is just learning to find what will raise his bench and what will not. No time is wasted. What’s next for Fred? Time will tell. It is important that he stay injury- free and prepare himself for stardom in the middle weights. At Westside we start a lifter in a direction to sooner or later reach the top. And we think Fred will Boldt to the top.\nLouie Simmons",

The dynamic method replaces a maximal effort day and builds explosiveness and speed strength. The maximal effort method builds strength speed and absolute strength.\nWe know that training with weights about 90% for 3 weeks will cause a negative training effect. To remedy this, the conjugate method is employed. Each week on maximal effort day we use a different core exercise and max out with 100% or more. It can be a good morning, pull, or special morning, pull, or special squat for the squat and deadlift or a floor press or board press for the bench press, to name a few.\nIf you think about it, strongman events are really the conjugate method. It’s not uncommon for a top strongman to deadlift 800 or more.\nMany don’t realize it, but we also use the repetition method to failure, never in the classical lifts, but rather with special exercises with dumbbells, belt squats, the Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2, and so forth. I prefer to do repetitions for time, not bothering to count reps, in a slow tempo.\nIf this sounds new to you, it’s not. In the 1970s the great Olympic lifter Vasili Alexeyev used a variation of the repetition method for part of his training, sometimes doing power cleans non-stop for 2-3 minutes. He would do various hybrid exercises: front squat and push press, squats with the bar on his back and drop squats, etc. The bar weight was light but would work every muscle cell. He would do a warm up by throwing a 220 pound barbell over his head backward 100 times. Then after practicing the snatch for over 2 hours, he would spend an hour in the pool, lifting his legs hundreds of times to strengthen his abdomen. Then he would leap merely 1000 times. He would use many exercises to gain great strength and to raise his work capacity, and of course his total. This is precisely what Westside is after.\nHere are some examples of how the repetition method is used at Westside:\nFor the squat or deadlift, I will do belt squat for 3 or4 sets of 3 minute sets, 2 or 3 sets of abs, or the Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 for 1-3 sets of 1-3 minutes each\nAnother workout consists of band good mornings, a single set sometimes lasting 6-8 minutes, depending on band tension. Follow this with light dumbbell presses for 2-4 minutes nonstop.\nWalk with a sled for up to 5 minutes with light resistance. Follow with ab work. Do light deadlifts for 1-3 minutes followed by ab work for at least 2 minutes.\nPick up a barbell and throw it overhead behind you or the same exercises with medicine balls. This works the entire body. After throwing it, simply walk over to it and do another rep.\nDo band leg curls for 3-6 minutes followed immediately by band leg extensions.\nDo dumbbell power cleans for 1-3 minutes, either holding them at your waist or on your shoulders, or of course over you head.\nDo dumbbell pressing on a bench or, my preference, on stability ball. I use three different weights depending on the day. After the dynamic workout, I use 100s for 3 minutes. On max effort day, I have done 75s for 5 minutes. Four or five times a week I use 40s for a set of 3-10 minutes.\nUsing weights of roughly 30% will serve as restoration, by not being heavy enough to stop adequate circulation via strong muscle contraction.\nTo validate some of the findings at Westside, in Science of Sports Training by Thomas Kurz, high reps with very light weight are stated as being beneficial in the rep range 100-200. Olympic long jumper Diane Guthrie had been doing 250 leg curls every day using 10 pound ankle weights. She noted that when she slacked off the work, she incurred leg injuries.\nPeople make a mistake thinking that there is only one method of training. In fact, there are many, and they must coexist in a continuous chain of proven methods.\nWhen doing the workouts I have outlined, remember to do them with a slow tempo. This means 6-10 reps per minute, resting between reps while still holding onto the bar or dumbbell. Regardless of where you hold the bar or dumbbell, it will work the muscles to their fullest extent.\nA great benefit of the repetition method is an increase not only in all strength but also in endurance. This method is also commonly known as lactic acid tolerance training. It promotes a high degree of growth hormone production, which can aid in size and strength.\nI suggest that at least two levels of intensity be used: one for strength and one for restoration, the latter using 30% of max or less. As your absolute strength increases, all you strength qualities increase. When I could do 100 pound dumbbells for 40 seconds, I could do 30s for 1 minute 30 seconds. Later when I did 100s for 3 minutes, I did 50’s for 8 minutes and 75s for 5 minutes. When your top strength goes up, so does you strength endurance with less than max weights.\nSize, strength endurance, and restoration can all be gained using this method. It is a simple and effective way to raise work capacity and volume to increase your total as well as your fitness level. This method worked for the greatest Olympic lifter of all time—Vasili Alexeyev—and currently and greatest bencher by formula—George Halert.\nLouie Simmons",

In fact, there are many, and they must coexist in a continuous chain of proven methods.\nWhen doing the workouts I have outlined, remember to do them with a slow tempo. This means 6-10 reps per minute, resting between reps while still holding onto the bar or dumbbell. Regardless of where you hold the bar or dumbbell, it will work the muscles to their fullest extent.\nA great benefit of the repetition method is an increase not only in all strength but also in endurance. This method is also commonly known as lactic acid tolerance training. It promotes a high degree of growth hormone production, which can aid in size and strength.\nI suggest that at least two levels of intensity be used: one for strength and one for restoration, the latter using 30% of max or less. As your absolute strength increases, all you strength qualities increase. When I could do 100 pound dumbbells for 40 seconds, I could do 30s for 1 minute 30 seconds. Later when I did 100s for 3 minutes, I did 50’s for 8 minutes and 75s for 5 minutes. When your top strength goes up, so does you strength endurance with less than max weights.\nSize, strength endurance, and restoration can all be gained using this method. It is a simple and effective way to raise work capacity and volume to increase your total as well as your fitness level. This method worked for the greatest Olympic lifter of all time—Vasili Alexeyev—and currently and greatest bencher by formula—George Halert.\nLouie Simmons",

George Frenn was discussing how important strong legs were to breaking squat records. He recommended several exercises and methods that he and Bill “Peanuts” West had developed over the years. They pushed box squatting on different height boxes, good mornings, and even calf work to develop their immense back strength. They were responsible for the first 800 pound squat, by Pat Casey.\nI realized they knew what they were doing. An old friend, Roger Estep, made the trip to Culver City and gained priceless knowledge. He brought back what he learned and shared it with a West Virginia group, later known as the Wild Bunch: Luke Iams, Jack Wilson, Chuckie Dunbar, and the rest of the guys in New Martinsville, WV. After talking to Roger, I was convinced.About 30 years later, we at Westside in Columbus, OH, continue to improve on what Bill West’s boys were doing by adding science and technology to the system.\nWe know that the best way to squat is to box squat, but what about building brute leg strength?\nBelt Squatting: this requires a special belt-squat belt. The weight hangs from the belt, allowing only the lower body to do the work. You may have seen our belt squat machine in our squat video. Belt squats can also be done on an incline; don’t lock out your legs.\nIncline Squats: do these with a MantaRay or on a flat surface. Safety Squat Bar: do these on an incline or on a flat surface. Regular Barbell SquatsFront Squats – Free Squats: do these for high reps: 50-500 reps. Hindu Squats: this is a variety of wrestling squat.\nOne-Legged Squat: do these with on leg supported behind you on a bench. This is also called a sprinter’s squat. You can also hold on to a support for a little resistance. The hardest one-legged squat is done by balancing yourself unassisted.\nWhen doing any type of squat, wear shoes with heels occasionally; this places the work more on the quads. Also squat as deep as possible. Depending on the amount of resistance, the reps are 5-12 per set. All of the above squats can be accomplished by holding a barbell or dumbbells.\nWhen doing any type of squat, wear shoes with heels occasionally; this places the work more on the quads. Also squat as deep as possible. Depending on the amount of resistance, the reps are 5-12 per set. All of the above squats can be accomplished by holding a barbell or dumbbells.\nOne of these is Zercher squats. Their inventor, Ed Zercher, intended for the bar to be lifted off the floor in the crook of the elbows. At 181, I made 320 off the floor and an official deadlift of 670 in 1973. But at 198, I could no longer bend over far enough to hook the bar in my elbows. At that point, I placed the bar on the power rack pins and squatted from there.\nSquatting can also be done to develop flexibility.\nLateral Roll Squat. Start by squatting down as deep as possible. Next, roll your bodyweight to the right leg in a lunge position, then shift to the left leg, and stand up. Squat down again and repeat in reverse.\nFrog Squat. Squat down with you hands over your head. Then place your hands between your legs and touch the floor.\nSide-Stepping Squat. With a jump, step out laterally with both feet while descending. Stand up and repeat.\nUneven Squat. While squatting, place one foot on a box about 6 inches high and do full squatting.\nThe variety of squats presented here are intended for flexibility and agility. Something that most lifters are lacking. Many of these squats are illustrated in Twisted Conditioning by Bud Jeffries (1-866-strnger). This book has training tips for powerlifting, strongman competitions, and no holds-barred fighting such as Vale Tudo, of which I am a big fan.\nOther leg developers are pushing cars forward or backward and walking with a heavy wheelbarrow. Jesse Kellum likes this type of training at certain times of the year and his legs are just about as strong as I have seen. At Westside we use sled pulling extensively.Here are more exercises for the posterior chain:\n• Walking Lunges: these can be done with a barbell or dumbbells.\n• Glute/Ham Raises: we do hundreds of these at Westside.\n• Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2 Machine: this builds the hamstrings, glutes, lower back and spinal erectors, plus acts as traction.\n• Inverse Curl: this is a form of glute/ham raise. The glute/ham bench is elevated in the back by about 30 inches. Do a partial leg curl and a back extension at the same time. Hold at the top position (do not push with the toes). This exercise works the hamstrings at the hip and knee insertions simultaneously. A standard leg curl will not do the same.\n• Leg Curls with Bands: do these seated on a bench in front of a power rack. Secure a band to the bottom of the rack, hook the band with the back of you ankles, and pull your fee under the bench.\n• Pull-throughs: use a low-pulley machine with a single handle. Grab the handle with both hands facing away from the machine. Walk out until there is tension and squat down. Let you hands go through your legs. Remember to keep your arms straight, then stand up and repeat. This is a great hamstring and glute builder. If done with straight legs, it will build incredible lower back strength.\n• Dimel Deadlifts: use a shoulder-width stance and grab the bar with your hands outside your legs. First stand up with your back straight and arched. Maintain this position and drop the bar to just below knee level by squatting down. Quickly return to the top. Do 15-20 reps for 2 sets. These can be done up to 4 days a week, but only for 2 weeks at the most. These are named after my dear friend Matt Dimel. They pushed his 820 squat, which was stalled for over a year, to 1010 in 16 months. The same exercise raised Steve Wilson’s deadlift to his all-time best of 865.\n• Deadlifts behind the Back: this will build great leg strength for deadlifting. If you have large hamstrings, this exercise may be difficult. Ano, the great Finn, is experimenting with these to get some leg drive back into his deadlift.\n• Wall Squats: Jesse Kellum suggested that I try these. This is static squat where you slide your back against a wall to an angle where you want to work you legs and hold from 15 to 60 seconds.\n• Plyometrics and Jumping: Paul Anderson was doing jumping exercises in the 1950’s. He would jump onto boxes of different heights to build explosive leg power. Norm Schomanski, our great Olympic lifting champion, also did a lot of jumping. He was reputedly able to jump onto a 4 foot high bar top at a local tavern. The benefits of kinetic energy on the lowering phase is that it produces a phantom loading effect on the landing. I highly suggest you do a lot of research on plyometrics before using them in your training. They must be used correctly.\n• I hope some of the exercises mentioned her can raise your squat and deadlift. Some of the exercises are very old, and some are relatively new, but all are proven to work. It’s up to you or your coach to place them where they can do the most good.\nLouie Simmons",

Bench press shirts are a major part of powerlifting, so get with the program. No one cares what you bench press without a shirt. There are a lot of gym world champs, as long as they stay in their own gym.\nI’ve always been a slightly above average bencher. I was eighth in 198- without a bench shirt and ninth in 1997 with a shirt. So if I can keep up with the times, so can you.Here at Westside we have 12 men who bench more than 600 and four over 700 at the time I am writing this. Also four different men at Westside have held an all-time world record. Is this a coincidence? Hardly. We have a training plan that is designed to produce explosive power and incredible absolute strength.\nI have discussed the dynamic method many times. Basically we use 45-50% of shirtless max with mostly close grips for 8 sets of 3 reps. This is followed by triceps, lats, and rear and side delt work. But what happens max effort day at Westside that has produced four 700 pound benchers, with more to come? We max out like the Bulgarians: Regardless of our level of preparedness, we do as much as possible on that day. While it may not be our all-time best, it is absolutely all we can do on that particular day.\nLet’s start with J.M. Blakley, who has done 710. J. M. likes to do floor presses. He drapes 200-320 pounds of chain over the bar, doing triples. After loading the chains he adds weight; after 225 he jumps 20 pounds a set. This adds up to 12- 18 total lifts.\nAnother exercise that is popular for J.M. (and myself) is the J.M. press. It is done with a close grip, lowering the bar in a straight line down toward the upper chest, stopping about 6 inches above the chest. The elbows are at a 45 deg angle from the body, thereby taking the delts out of the lift, leaving the triceps to do most of the work. I refer to these as J.M., who first demonstrated them for us. J.M. is very dedicated to powerlifting, having traveled all over the United States and overseas to compete. I am honored that he represents us with such passion and dignity.\nKenny Patterson was the youngest to bench 700 at 22 years old. He has held all-time world records in the 275, 242, and 220 weight classes, and no doubt will break more records. One of Kenny’s favorite exercises is overhead band press. Using a set of blue Jump-Stretch bands that reduce the load 155 pounds at chest level, he will work up to a max single. For most lifters, this combination will equal their contest best. This is done without a bench shirt. Kenny says these have taught him to accelerate to the top. One learns that the weight adds on quickly as the bar reaches the top. This method truly is accommodating resistance. Kenny will also have a record with green or pink Jump-Stretch bands.\nKenny’s Favorite triceps extension is with dumbbells with palms facing each other. He has worked up to 125’s for sets of 8-10 reps. That takes strong triceps, and that’s what it takes to break world records.\nRob Fusner has benched an all-time record of 735 at 308. What makes Rob so incredible is that he has totaled 2358 in a full meet. One of Rob’s favorite exercises is the floor press with bands. The bands add roughly 170 pounds at the top. Rob will use a close to moderately close grip. After starting with the bands, he will add weight and work up to a max single.Rob’s standard triceps extension exercise is steep incline dumbbell extensions with the elbows pointed out to the sides and the dumbbells touching the upper chest. They remain touching as Rob extends them to the top. This method really works the area around the elbows, and this area is responsible for locking out the arms. Rob will perform 8-12 reps for sets until the triceps are fatigued. We look for Rob to not only break more bench records but also break the total record some day.\nGeorge Halbert was stuck at a 475 bench for 2 years. After joining us, he made an official 628 after 1 year of training at 275. George had a lock-out problem, but obviously he solved it. He dropped down to 198 and made a 683. Then George jumped up to 215 and made 701, 716, and 733 at one meet. This is the greatest bench press according to coefficient to date. How does he do it? Well, I’ll tell you two ways and only ways for now.\nGeorge’s lock-out problem was addressed by board press with bands. George has done 365 on the bar plus 400 pounds of band tension off four boards, and Rob did 345 plus 400 pounds of bands. George said he could lock-out that much and so could Rob. He was right. George had the stamina to do three benches over 700 at 215, while Rob made 661, 694, 716, and 735. As long as you are explosive enough to blast the weight into the lock-out zone, you can lock-out almost anything.\nThe second exercise helps George blast the bar into that zone. On dynamic day George, being very strong and explosive, uses 170 pounds of band tension at the top. This also provides 80 pounds of tension at the bottom. George does his speed sets, jumping 5 pounds each set up to 245 for a total of 8 working sets.\nBands have many benefits. One is accommodating resistance. Second, they add kinetic energy in the eccentric phase, by out-accelerating gravity. Third, bands work much like muscle and connective tissue. Fourth, they build tremendous stability: just watch someone trying to bench with bands for the first time.\nI have talked about four of the greatest benchers on the planet. They will lift anywhere and any time, out of respect for out competitors and for the sake of competing.I have presented eight exercises, but there are many more to choose from. They all work for someone, and you may be that someone.\nTo close, I have some personal advice for all who read my articles: I keep a bottle of testosterone sitting on a triple-layer bench press shirt in the back of my gym, but I have yet to see it bench 5 pounds. To be great, it takes planning, work, dedication, courage, and aggression. If you lack one of these, you will fail, and you have on one to blame but yourself. Losers hate winners, so it’s better to be hated in powerlifting than to hate.\nLouie Simmons",

OR MISS\"> Related Topics: Exercise Programming, Football, Louie Simmons, Strength Training for Sports, Strength Training Methods Many readers may not realize that I am involved in the training of pro-football teams and many college football and basketball teams. For example, the Kansas City Jayhawks and Utah Utes are heavily influenced by our training as it relates to speed strength. Two of the pro- football teams are the Green Bay Packers and the New England Patriots. Not a bad group to be associated with, huh? I also talk to a head strength coach that has been affiliated with a winning tradition in the NFL who tells me, although he is ashamed to admit it, that he has linemen coming into the league that can’t vertical jump 19 inches or squat 300 pounds. He related to me that these players are from “high-intensity training” (H.I.T.) schools and that this type of weight program is making his job next to impossible.\nA pro-lineman told me while I was at their camp that when he was placed on the H. I.T. program in college, his team was the top 5th school his senior year. He thought he was strong until the combines. When he got only 12 repetitions with 225 pounds, he was embarrassed. He was picked by a pro-team that utilized our training and that has an excellent strength coach. In 2 years this lineman did 17 reps with 315 pounds. He made a remark that machines and H.I.T. were useless. This got back to his old college team, who immediately banned him for life from their weight room. Gee, what a pity. Concept of intensity At Westside, we thought we would do some research on H.I.T. So Dave Tate and myself looked into this, I must say, misguided method. What is their viewpoint? Where was their research taken from? Why is it loved by some and despised by others?\nFirst let’s look at the concept of intensity. Apparently H.I.T. views it as a feeling, like a pump, a term bodybuilders made popular. Is it a scientific term? No. Is a bodybuilder quick or explosive? No. If you know a converted bodybuilder who powerlifts, he almost always lifts well under what he appears to be able to do. Why? He has trained only the muscle, not the central nervous system. That is why smaller ball players are almost always faster and many times stronger based on percent of bodyweight. Bodybuilders develop no reversal strength or starting or accelerating strength. Any sport coach will tell you that acceleration is paramount in sports.\nA. S. Prilepin suggested that to achieve the proper intensity, one should use the rep/set scheme shown in the table, to ensure the greatest development of speed and strength. He discovered that if 7 or more reps were performed at 70%, the bar speed slowed and power decreased. The same holds true when using 80% or 90%; once one goes above the rep range shown, the bar slows, which translates to less power. Doing fewer or more lifts than Prilepin suggests will cause a decrease in training effect.\nNumber of Reps for Percent Training Percent\nReps Per Set\nOptimal Total\nRange 55-65\n3-6\n24\n18-30 70-75\n3-6\n18\n12-24 80-85\n2-4\n15\n10-20 90+\n1-2\n7\n4-10 (Taken From Managing The Training of the Weightlifter)\nAlong the same parameters are the findings of Dr. Tamas Ajan and Prof. Lazar Baroga. They describe the zones of intensity as follows: 30 to 50% is low intensity; for speed-oriented sports; 50 to 85% is medium intensity; for force-oriented sports such as weightlifting; 85 to 95% is high intensity, for weightlifting and other sports; 100% and above is maximum and over-maximum Intensity, for the development of absolute strength. Speed, speed, and more speed. Most authors who have studied strength as a physical quality examine it in four forms: absolute, speed, explosive, and strength endurance. The latter, strength endurance is basically all the H.I.T. program can possibly build. Strength endurance is characterized by a combination of great strength and significant endurance. It is needed by athletes who must compete for a prolonged period of time (3 to 4 hours) without diminished work capacity. Well H.I.T. may increase endurance, but it does not promote great strength; in fact, it eliminates it completely by neglecting the other three elements of strength: absolute, speed, and explosive.\nDave Caster showed me an interesting paper, Strength, Power and Speed in Shot Put Training, by Dr. Poprawski, Director of the Sport High Performance Institute in Toronto and former coach of world shot put champion Edward Sarul. First, Poprawski realized the importance of intensity zones as described by Prilepin and the importance of using one weight percentage per workout. For example, weights of 50 to 75% were used for training speed and power. Much like our training, this training is based on a true max of, let’s say, 500,600, or 700 pounds. Poprawski realized that a shot put always weighs 16 pounds; therefore he found that it was best to use one weight for a particular workout and to focus on increasing bar velocity rather than heavier weight to increase power. What was the key element for success? Speed, speed, and more speed.\nSarul was tested against other superior throwers, and while some could lift more weight, he was far ahead in tests of bar speed during the snatch and squats of 1 and 3 reps. His advantage in speed and the development of power was directly achieved by increasing bar speed, while the others fell behind from lifting too slowly. What does this tell us? Fast is good; slow is second team.\nH.I.T. proponents use a lot of machines. This is truly a mistake. No stability can be developed. Most machines work on the peak contraction theory. Let’s look at the pec machine. If you load a pec machine to the max, starting the movement requires a max effort, which is very difficult and dangerous. Yet at the finish, where the most weight can be lifted because of accommodating resistance, machines show their downfall.\nMore importantly, let’s consider the strength curve. Take the case of two 700- pound deadlifters. One may blast the weight off the floor to near lockout and then fight the last 3 to 4 inches. The second may have difficulty starting the bar off the floor, pick up speed, and lockout easily. What does this illustrate? In the real world of strength these two lifters have quite different strength curves. If these same two lifters were to use a machine, only one would receive any benefit from that machine, because the machine has a predetermined strength curve. That’s a 50% chance the machine won’t work for you. Also, a machine will not build stability. The only good thing about a facility full of machines is that the instructor could be a moron and it won’t make any difference. 100-pound dumbbells H.I.T. proponents for some reason think that explosive weight training is dangerous. One should know that explosive weight training should only be done after warming up past 25% of a 1-rep max. Look at the percent charts by Ajan and Baroga, and then start at 30%. Don’t push super-light weights explosively until you reach 30%. If you’re going to criticize something, you should understand it first. Finally I ask, is anything more dangerous than football itself?\nH.I.T. proponents also think that if you exercise slowly, you won’t become slow. Have they heard of exercise specificity? A sprinter must practice sprinting to be successful. A long-distance runner must learn to conserve himself to run a long distance; if a marathon runner was to start sprinting from the beginning, he or she would run out of gas long before the end of the race. If you work slowly, you will become slow, and you will be watching the fast kids play while you develop splinters in your butt. Remember that external force is directly responsible for speed. A boxer may appear very fast with 8-ounce boxing gloves, but hand him a pair of 100-pound dumbbells and he can hardly move his hands at all.\nAlthough I am not a proponent of the Olympic lifts, they certainly have a place in weight training. However, I must say the term ‘quick lift’ applies only to the snatch and clean and jerk when sub-maximal weights are used. With max weights they are no quicker than any other lift. That’s why we devote one workout a week to the dynamic method, with weights close to 60% of a 1rep max, for multiple sets of 2 or 3 reps and with short rest periods, almost exactly duplicating the play time and rest time of football.\nH.I.T advises you to work to failure, especially in the concentric phase, sometimes up to 10 to 15 seconds. They call this an isometric rep. Well, if you were to exercise for that length of time, which is much longer than a football play, it would be of absolutely no benefit. A good friend of mine was at a football conference and watched a demonstration in the deadlift for reps. The person did 20 or 25 reps with 425 pounds. Wow, what an effort! But did he recover in 35 seconds, the time period the football game requires? Absolutely not! Wouldn’t it be more beneficial to exercise for 7 to 8 seconds and repeat a set of weights? That’s how the game is played, right? A workout like that described above is fine for a 2-week mini-cycle, but no longer. A pro-boxer trains for a 3-minute round using training intervals of 3 minutes and a rest time of 1 minute. Football should do the same. Active work should duplicate a play and rest cycle. The friend I am referring to is a coach who is a two-time all American. Using our program, he currently has over 68 men who can power clean 300 pounds or more, out of 90. Injury-prone I give credit to the recruiters for teams who use H.I.T.. They pick skilled people who can sometimes survive H.I.T., but the linemen cannot survive. If you watch the Heisman Trophy winner who was on the H.I.T. program as a college athlete and is drafted by a pro-team who uses H.I.T., invariably he is nonproductive or injury-prone.Guys, if you want to play for pay, check out the weight facility. If there are more machines than weights and you’re not in the snack room, think twice before entering. The truth is the H.I.T. philosophy comes from companies that sell machines. Even Arthur Jones realized that doing one set to failure was a mistake and retracted his statements years ago. It was merely a ploy to run as many customers through a facility as possible. It was later popularized by Mike Mentzer; a successful bodybuilder in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. His claim to fame was the one-set-to-failure system. He was, I might add, the only one to use it successfully.\nIt’s not a good idea to try to be the exception to the rule. Instead, follow the accepted methods of weight training by working on the many types of strength that are needed in a sport. Just remember what Bill Starr said: only the strong will survive.\nLouie Simmons References Komi, P.

In Bulgaria, where many of the greatest lifters come from, the system is straightforward. Anyone who wants to reach the top (juniors and seniors) must go through the main training facility. They do few exercises. This requires that one is ideally built to succeed, with a particular body structure and muscle type. One must also possess a high work capacity with near-limit weights. As many as six training sessions per day are used. This was a proven system and was used for more than 20 years. Only the strongest survived. This system produced high results, as well as a high burn-out ratio.\nBulgaria is a small country and is economically depressed. Sport was a way out of poverty. This meant that everyone tries his best, for himself and his country. For every lifter that makes it, many go back home denied entrance. The Bulgarian training system was designed to produce one goal: one Olympic medal run. They succeeded through the process of selection of body structure to progress with a small number of exercises: snatch, clean and jerk, power snatch, power clean and jerk, and front and back squats. The athletes had to have the ability to lift maximum weight in more than one workout a day with a 30 minute break between workouts. They had to be able to do the second workout with less time on warm ups. The junior and senior teams trained together. There had to be top coaches. Normally there were three involved with the top 20 lifters. Their national coach was Ivan Abadjiev. Because he was the top coach, little variation in the system occurred.\nAnother super-power was the former Soviet Union. Their system was very thought out. They sought to develop top lifters with an assortment of means. The former Soviet system was vast, consisting of many thousands of lifters and a large number of coaches, many former highly ranked lifters. With so many coaches, many combinations of training evolved, consisting of different loading schemes, exercises, tapering methods, and restoration. Because of the many types of body structures, it became clear that the same exercises would not work for everyone.\nIn 1972, the Dynamo Club experimented with a system of exercises that were constantly revolved. A group of 72 lifters, all masters or international masters of sport, used 20-45 different exercises. At the end of the experiment, only one lifter was satisfied with the number of exercises; the rest wanted more. This was the conjugate method.\nMuch research was brought to the United States after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Do you know who were the first Soviets to participate in the Olympics? They were not sportsmen, but camera men and biomechanics experts and coaches. They studied the best athletes from all over the world and at first copied them. Later, however, they introduced new innovations in training. (This is exactly what Westside has done.) They had so much training data that many of their own coaches could not access it all.\nNevertheless, they had hard proof of what works and what doesn’t. Many of their coaches were top lifters, training along with other lifters. The very best were on the national of military teams. They were proud of their heritage and defended it fiercely. Their training methods spread to other communist countries. They had templates to examine the strength and weaknesses of all athletes.\nHere is an example for a 110 kg lifter (from “Weight Lifting Fitness for All Sports”). To be superior, a 110 kg (242) had to be capable of the following: power snatch 396 pounds\npower clean 484 pounds\nfront squat 573 pounds\nback squat 639 pounds\nclose-grip bench 418 pounds Does the U.S. weightlifting team do this? Hell no. This can be the difference between progression and regression. I have used the methods of many Russians. I have thanked some of them before, but can’t possibly thank all of them or mention all their names. But here are some of them. V. Zatsiorsky’s book, “Science and Practice of Strength Training”, confirms that Westside is on the right track. Y. V. Verkhoshansky was the father of the shock system of training. A. S. Medvedyev, with his insight into training and restoration, brought my attention to the importance of changing volume and intensity during different phases of training.\nA. S. Prilepin’s research in determining the optimal training loads by intensity zone and number of lifts per workout is the foundation of training at Westside. Another super-power is the Chinese. They have made great strides in all sports, but weight lifting is in the forefront. The Chinese have always been proficient in weight lifting. They have thousands of candidates to choose from. They have always lead the way in acupuncture, acupressure, Tai Chi, and meditative methods. Their system was strengthened by adding former Soviet coaches. They have raised high-volume training to new heights. In a video filmed in a world championship training hall, I saw a 14-year-old boy squat 370, snatch grip deadlift 330, and clean/jerk 242. This was at a body weight of 110 pounds!\nThe Chinese select a group a lifters whose body can withstand the maximum loads required to reach the Olympics. They have barracks after barracks of lifters to choose from. It’s a way out of poverty. They pick the best coaches, then assemble the best lifters. They already had perhaps the best psychological and physiological methods. Add all this up and you have a juggernaut. It’s quite simple really. They break training down into separate units to make a whole. This is an example of the conjugate method.\nIn addition to the Russian method, now we have the Chinese method to learn from. But will we? With similar methods taught by the Russian coaches but with a higher work capacity, there seems to be no limit.\nI have talked about three powerhouse countries. What about the fourth– Westside Barbell? Many people compare the world’s best lifters to ours. Some say, “Hey Louie, those Russian lifters are some of the greatest and they don’t follow your methods.” They also bring up names such as Ed Coan, Steve Goggins, Beca Swanson, and Gary Frank, who is the strongest man I’ve ever seen. They say, “Why don’t your guys squat as much as Brent Mikesell or bench like Gene Rychlak, and what about Andy Bolton’s deadlift?” Well, these lifters are spectacular to say the least, and they have my admiration and respect. They make a lift that seems unbreakable but then manage to break it.\nBut nowhere else is there a stronger collection of lifters than at Westside. In international competitions, they score the top six lifters. Our top six guys rival those of any other nation. They look like this on the Westside all-time ranking list. Chuck Vogelpohl’s 2319 total at 220–3rd all-time\nJoe Bayles’s 2300 total at 242–4th all-time\nJohn Stafford’s 2415 total at 275–4th all-time\nJ. L. Holdsworth’s 2340 total at 275–6th all-time\nMike Ruggiera’s 2505 total at SHW–6th all-time\nMatt Smith’s 2502 total at SHW–7th all-time These totals were all made within the last 12 months. In addition, behind these six, we have more back-up than an NWA concert. Amy Weisberger is only 16 pounds off a 10 times bodyweight total at 132. We had the youngest 700 bencher, Kenny Patterson, at 22 years old, in 1995. Kenny was also the lightest to bench 700 (701) at 238. George Halbert beat that, 733 at 215. We had three teens bench over 600. Anthony Clark was first to bench 600 as a teen. Then it was Westside’s Andre Henry (605), Tim Harrold (615), and Mike Brown, who as of April made 670 easily at barely 19 years old. At the same meet J. L.\nHoldsworth made 775 at 284, and another lifter who may not be so familiar, Paul Keys, hit 750 at 286; the last two hit 800 on third attempts but got them turned down.\nAt the time of writing, Tim Harrold became the youngest man, at 20 years old (2/4/84), to bench 700, and I believe the youngest to total 2400. This pushes our 700 benchers to 8 and those with a 2400 total or higher to 4. John Stafford totaled 2415 at 275. Matt Smith and Mike Ruggiera totaled 2502 and 2505, respectively. No gym has four totals like this.\nLet’s not forget Fred Boldt’s 584 at 181. He will be our next world record holder. We had four men break the all-time bench record: Doug Heath, Kenn Patterson, George Halbert, and Rob Fusner. These men have accumulated 20 all-time records.We recently dropped the 500 bench club at Westside: we felt that having 63 members on the list over the years took some luster off it. So now we calculate only 550 and up; we have 43 on this list.\nChuck Vogelpohl is the lightest lifter to squat 1000. At 220 bodyweight he has made 1025. His best lifts add up to 2419. We also have 23 members who squat 800 or more, 8 over 900, and 4 over 1000. We have 8 lifters who bench 700 or more and 7 800-pound deadlifters. Twelve members total 2000 or more, 8 total over 2100, 6 total over 2200, 5 total over 2300, and 4 total over 2400.\nI wrote this article for all of you, like Roy Jones Jr. says, in case you forgot. Some of our own lifters don’t know our history, and I just wanted to inform our fans and anyone else who would listen.\nLouie Simmons",

Round and round he goes, going nowhere fast, until he finally realizes he’s right back where he started. But I will give him credit; at least he knows he’s going nowhere fast. My dog attended obedience school for 4 weeks, so maybe he has an advantage over his human counterparts, i.e., those Ph.D.s in exercise physiology in schools that are still teaching progressive gradual overload. I recently read an article by a U.S. Ph.D. He described a yearly plan consisting of four phases. The first phase is designed to increase muscle mass, i.e., hypertrophy, and to increase the training base.\nA point that must be made is that after the end of phase 1, in as little as 2 weeks, your muscle size will start to diminish, by 10-15% causing, in a sense, a detraining effect. The stronger the lifter, the faster this will happen. For example, work your lats or abs intensely for 2 or 3 weeks. This does not make much sense to me, and I hope it doesn’t make sense to you either.\nRaising muscle mass, if that is the goal, or raising GPP is not only a yearly goal but a multi-year goal. It can be accomplished by incorporating a dynamic day, on which just one of a variety of special strengths is refined, and a maximal effort day that occurs 72 hours later using several set of well-thought-out exercises for the particular muscle groups that need strengthening. This can also be accomplished by doing extra workouts during the week. Level of Preparedness For max strength, weights from 30 to 100%+ of a 1 rep max are used, which causes a restricted blood supply, resulting in a hard muscle contraction, thus providing a strength gain. The extra workouts that use weight or resistance less than 30% will effect restoration by increasing circulation. Ten extra workouts a week is a normal load. Doing special exercises for the classical lifts will increase you strength and perfect form. Concentrate on only the muscle groups that aid in raising the lift or total. For example, don’t squat, but do special exercises for squatting, such as glute/ham raises, pull-throughs, Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2, or belt squat, plus ab work. Also do exercises for flexibility.\nIn place of benching, do triceps extensions with a bar, dumbbells, or bands, delt raises, lats, upper lock, and external rotation work. With this method, one never stops building muscle mass. Switch exercises that work the same muscles (the conjugate method). This will allow one to constantly build muscle mass, GPP, and SPP.\nAccording to the article I was reading, phase 2 is the precompetitive phase, normally lasting. The Ph.D. now states one must raise top strength, or absolute trength. During this phase the lifter concerns himself with raising his squat, deadlift, and bench press using all major exercises, rack work, good mornings, etc.\nLet’s look at an alternative method: the maximal effort method. This incorporates the conjugate method: using special exercises that closely resemble the classical lifts. Examples are squatting with special devices, such as the MantaRay or cambered bar, concentric work, good mornings, or deadlifts using the contrast or reactive method. The weights are always100% plus, depending on your level of preparedness, i.e., how close one is to top lifting form, which incidentally should never drop below 90% of your all-time records.\nThe maximal effort method is calculated much like the Bulgarian system, meaning always doing the most possible, even when far from contest time. As you can clearly see, this method allows you to lift you current max every week of the year, not just for a few weeks near one or two contests during the year. What about Absolute Strength? Well, so far the Ph.D.s from the U.S. advocate building muscle mass, then allowing it to disappear after ceasing the hypertrophy phase. This is not training, but detraining. The same happens after phase 2. The Westside method, however allows one to become larger and more muscular and stronger all year long.The Ph.D.’s classes are now learning phase 3, for explosive strength. This phase again lasts about 6 weeks. For this phase the main goal is to increase bar speed. The weight here reaches 60-85% of a 1 rep max, and they add plyometrics. Then they move into the peaking or contest phase. Here they recommend going from high reps, light weights or high volume, low intensity to heavy weights, low reps, which results in lower volume, but high intensity.\nControlling volume and intensity is very important. When one does sets with 70, 75, 80 and then 85% for doubles, it is impossible for the lifter to understand what task is the goal. How do you determine if you are lifting with the same effectiveness at each percentage? If the weights are moving at the same max rate of acceleration, all is well. But when the weights are raised that high, this is not possible. Rule of thumb: train at intensities of 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90-100%+. Prilepin’s studies of more than 100 Olympic, National, and European champions showed that there is an optimal number of reps at certain percent ranges. If one uses one percent per work-out, the task is easier to realize. Lighter weights are used for explosive and speed strength (60-80%) and weights of 90% or more for strength speed. It is not advisable to train for two types of strength in one workout.\nHere’s how it is done. For speed strength, use a pendulum wave. During week 1, us 60% for multiple sets: 1 rep pulls, 2 reps for the squat, and 3 reps in the bench. Week 2: 65%. Week 3: 70%. Then drop back to 60% on week 4 and 65% on week 5. Use 70% on week 6. Then drop back down again. This is a pendulum wave. This kind of wave is used because on cannot increase in speed or top strength after 3 weeks of increasing the weight. If one continues to increase the weight, the bar speed will suffer dramatically, which must not happen.\nWhat about absolute strength? Three days separate the dynamic workout and the max effort day. This is because the major muscle groups recuperate in 72 hours. The max effort workout is performed with the conjugate method. This allows one to lift weights of 100%+ each week. This is possible by switching exercises each week.\nFor example, for the squat and the deadlift day, week 1, 10-inch low box with the MantaRay; week 2, bent-over good mornings; week 3, 12-inch low box with the Safety Squat bar. For the bench press, week 1, three-board press; week 2, floor press; week 3 lightened band press. There are many core exercises to choose from. For the Olympic lifter, wee1, snatch grip high pulls; week 2, straight leg power cleans; week 3, cleans from above the knee.\nThis method of training allows one to work on weak areas often overlooked by doing the classical lifts. It will also perfect form and coordination. This type of training also allows one to perform extra workouts for strength, restoration and flexibility.\nWith the progressive overload method, it is virtually impossible to control the volume. But, if you train at one percent range, it is easily controlled. To squat 600, we know that a total volume of 7200 pounds is needed. This is arrived at by using a top percent of 60% and a lower percent of 50%. For example, 50% of 600= 300 x 12 sets of 2 reps = 7200 pounds. On week 3 the weight is 60% of 600 = 360 x 10 sets of 2 reps = 7200. A volume of 9600 is used to squat 800. 50% of 800 = 400 x 12 sets of 2 reps = 9600 pounds. 10 sets of 2 reps with 480 (60%) = 9600 pounds. This works for any squat of any weight. This is called flat loading. During the 3 week wave you also rotate special exercises such as glute/ham raises, pull-throughs, and the Reverse Hyper®5356,359 and 6,491,607b2. In week 1, you are unfamiliar with the exercise that will promote a bigger squat, so the volume is understandably low. By week 3 you have grown familiar with the exercises and the volume grows.\nOne cannot succeed by doing only the classical lifts. One will cease to make progress. The greater the lifter, the more tasks you need to stimulate progress.\nProgressive gradual overload accomplishes only one goal at a time, while actually detraining the phase you just completed in as fast as 2 or 3 weeks. In addition, after a contest you must start over exactly where you started. But the system Westside has adapted from the old Soviet system allows you to build muscle mass, speed, and absolute strength, perfect form, raise you GPP, increase you flexibility, and provides restoration all year long, year after year. WE raise all qualities gradually, never neglecting one for another.\nLouie Simmons",

Yee Systems in a unique three volume encyclopedia, plus an additional solo training video, consisting of a proven exercise method that is unlike any other training program in the world. The concept for Yee Systems was created in 1968, refined in prison but has never been promoted until now.\nYee Systems is an off balanced partner training system that is unpredictable from one repetition to the next. Yee system uses your opponents’ body weight and resistance to achieve what machines and weights cannot do.\nYee system never repeats the same sequence of exercise, and can be done from beginners to advanced athletes. Yee Systems can be done in addition to any and all other sports programs or conducted separately in accordance with the infrastructures articulated within volumes I, II, III and solo training.\nFlashback\nYee systems is not something new, just never introduced until now. The year was 1968, I was a scrawny 12 year old standing in line to do pullups with the rest of the gym class. Needless to say I fell hard and was mocked, unable to do a lousy pullup. It was either send away for the Charles Atlas course (yea… kicking sand in the face treatment) or figure this thing out.\nOur back yard had a maple tree so I climbed up reaching for a sturdy limb attempting my first successful pullup. I was so weak that I lost my grip falling hard and rolling backwards. Not only did I crack my skull, I ended up in the push-up position. The light bulb that went off wasn’t me seeing stars, it was get back up, do a pull-up, land into a low squat, roll backwards and do a push-up. Days later I was the proud owner of my first J.C. Penny 110lb barbell set.\nThe problem was I was too weak to get out of the trunk of the car. The solution was keep tossing the plates on the grass working my way down the hill so I could pile them in the basement. Wait a second! Why don’t I run each plate to the tree then attempt the failed pull-up sequence. You guessed it, by the time by the time by the time I got the weights to the tree I was too tired to climb it. Are you getting the picture here? A micro version of holistic gone ballistic! Never give up! There’s always tomorrow! That’s when the concept of training without a name was born.\nDid it work? Rolls, jumps, spins, there was definite improvement, but how do you really know stacked up against the completion. I still had to work twice as hard to keep up with everything else. Having played sports in school and motocross (ok motocross wasn’t considered a real sport back then) you learn what it takes to stay off the bench. If you were average it was called recreation. On the other hand, if you were outstanding the sky was the limit. One thing that stood out back in the seventies was the push for boxing, bodybuilding gyms and martial arts.\nThere’s nothing wrong wanting to look like Arnold, fight like Bruce Lee or box like Muhamad Ali. My superiors were disciplined, expected a lot, but it had to be either their way or the highway. I set my training aside for the traditional way. It was all sets, reps, ringwork, kicks and forms. Since there was only one Arnold and Bruce Lee and one Ali, I realized that it was genetics that dictated the cream of the crop. You could do their program a hundred times over, and never come close to their physique and ability. So where do you fall in with the genetics inherited? Guess if you don’t like something, you can always blame your parents.\nGo West\nOur summers meant flying out to the bay area (the land of the milk and honey) and while standing waves it felt like earth was moving. While some took to the surf, I looked at Mother Nature as a way to stay off balance. How? By bear crawling along the beach as the waves rolled in. my body was thrown off balance and had to figure a way to keep moving.\nBear crawls lead to push-ups against the waves which caused most by standers to gawk and stare. (Like the dude is retarded) The San Bruno Mountains was my next outdoor workout. The steep angles of dried grass and sail allowed me to experiment with certain moves. It was harder to do clapping push-ups moving backwards up the slope while spinning 360 degrees, so why not follow up with lunges, hops and crab crawls in the same manner.\nTo do this I say “hill training is king.” Back east the metro parks had jogging paths and bike trails for the public to play on. I kind of looked at it like…. “Why take the easy way when you can run through the woods like Tarzan.” (except when squirrel hunting of course)\nAm I on the right path?\nWhen you come with a different approach that people haven’t seen in any magazine, you’ll always hear “Prove it!” it seemed like whatever I said was met with a ho-hum attitude, especially from the traditionist that had been handed down generations of blood sweat and tears. Like who was going to listen to a teenager anyways? It’s hard to prove something when they refuse to do it themselves.\nI couldn’t show body performance on a graph or under a microscope. If I was doing spinning jump drills over a flat bench, my instructor would do spinning outside and inside crescent kicks jumping around the Do Jang saying, “why do your stuff when we have our own way.” My response “Off balance forces you to stabilize.\nYou’re not going to move any better doing the same thing over and over again. It’s adapt and change.” Perhaps I hit a nerve when it was time to part ways. The traditional style had its place. Mine was just evolving.\nWhat? Someone agrees? In the competitive world called life you’ll learn that there’s two types of people. Assets and liabilities. The liabilities were winning until I met Dr. Paul Ward who was teaching physiology and circuit training at Victanny International. He was the first person to encourage me saying “you’re ahead of your time, you got something big here.” I’ll always remember those words, but something kept gnawing at me that my theory was incomplete. What in the world could it be?\nViolence begets more violence\nSometimes the answer is in your face and you’ll never recognize it until you’re about to lose it. A motorcycle chain of all things was being used to clear an area while quickly disarming the culprit meant dragging him into an area where he could do no harm. What a workout! Hence the concept of partner resistance off balance training.\nThe 80’s\nRunning wide open was an adventure in itself and the lifestyle came to an abrupt end. You learn a lot from past mistakes and believe me, I’ve made more than most. So much that my last day of freedom was 3-7-1989. You can’t turn back time and when the gravel fell all seemed for not, or was it?\nA life of lockdown\nAlthough my world changed it didn’t stop me from working out on a daily basis. The problem was the administration in the Federal and State prisons despised everything I was doing showing others a better way to train. I was constantly going to the hole (segregation) on the accusations of martial arts training.\nMy defense, “my system of exercise is not a martial art, but a better way for all athletes to move better.” Prison is about common sense. It’s about authority and although admitting I was right off to the side it was usually “guilty!” Well, so much for the thought of self-improvement and rehabilitation.\nThe results are in\nI was batting a thousand. Everyone I worked with moved faster with superior coordination not to mention major strength gains which surprised those who swore weight lifting was the only way to go. It was holistic gone ballistic and I didn’t need charts or graphs or even scientific proof that it worked.\nThe program wasn’t inexhaustible with each individual making overall gains far beyond their expectations.\nEnter the dragon\nI worked with mma/ muay thai fighter Mark Enix who knew the importance of extreme conditioning. After he went home I received a picture displaying a logo that his team wore. The words “Yee System” stood out on his muay thai shorts. I was really humbled.\nA purpose of helping A friend and contributor Dave Feathers kept suggesting “Steve, get this out to the public, there’s nothing like it. You’ll help a lot of people.” Seeing is believing after decades of imprisonment, I really wasn’t sure how to tackle such a feat. If there’s a will there’s a way\nHow do you get your point across when you’re separated from society?Learn to draw. Hence the Bic Pen action figures.\nThe hate continues\nHow typical. A few more trips to the hole with my initial sketches being confiscated and never returned. To this day I’ve been banned from doing my own workout. At least I have the satisfaction of knowing that the partner resistance off balanced training system will eventually help millions worldwide one day.\nTry, try again\nNearly 3,000 pages of sketches and theory later, volumes I, II and III were finished. The theory of Yee Systems is inexhaustible and realized the three years it took to draw was just the tip of the iceberg. Hence Yee Systems solo training. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

There is a lot to learn on how to use a bench shirt, but you must also raise your raw strength as well. Westside has had nine men capable of a 600-pound raw bench over the years. Many know about our “max-effort day” workouts, each week choosing a different barbell exercise. These seven examples show the range of exercises: Power rack pin pressing up to G position\nBoard pressing one to five boards\nBoard pressing with three different band tensions\nIncline press close and wide grip\nDecline press close and wide grip\nFloor press close and wide grip\nSeated press close and wide grip. The list above can be altered with bands, chains and different angles. Also on max-effort day a complete workout can be done with dumbbells or weighted push-ups. The dumbbells are done on flat, seated, incline and decline benches. One workout would call for working up to a top weight, and performing three sets to failure. Pick one dumbbell weight, say 100, 125 or 155 pounds. Set a record for one set, plus the three-set total. Remember to test all four angles.\nBefore bench shirts, weighted push-ups played a large part of Westside’s bench press training. We set records with just bodyweight or with a 45-pound or a 100-pound plate held on the upper back. Later as our strength became greater a training partner would sit on our upper back for resistance. Training partners could be a female around 120 pounds or a 140-pound man for starters, moving to a lifter of 200, 220 or 275 pounds and even 300 pounds for reps.\nTo do push-ups, lay a bar in the bottom of the power rack. Now, place your hands on the bar just as if you were benching. To change angles, place your feet on the floor. Next raise your feet on a 12-inch 18-inch or a 24-inch box or even a 30-inch box. The higher the box the more it works like an incline press.\nThe higher the feet the more blood will run into the upper body. This is a great muscle builder similar to dumb bells. After the main exercises, go to tricep extensions with a barbell or curl bar. Dumbbell roll backs or elbows out extensions that Jim Williams made famous also are good. You can do upper back, lats, and side rear delts, but be careful not to over train the front delts.\nSpeed Day\nMost know Westside for doing speed strength benching with roughly 50 percent bar weight plus 30 percent bend tension. Three grips are used in the same workout: three sets of three reps with the index finger touching the smooth part of the bar, three sets with a medium grip, and three sets with the little finger touching the ring on the bar. This adds up to 27 lifts. These lifts are for the development of a fast rate of force.\nWestside had a second method to build muscle by doing much higher volume. The development for this method had its start in 1971 while I was lifting in a meet. I had a 340 raw bench at 172-pound bodyweight. This is where I met Bill Seno for the first time. Bill was massive.\nHe won several best chest awards in a Mr. America contest. Bill was also a record holder in the bench press, so I asked him if he could help my bench. I will never forget what happened next. He grabbed me by the arms, then the shoulders and said with your build you need to do a workout of six reps on each set, working up each week as to weight. That taxed me, but did not max me out with an illegal grip. After nearing a plateau, I started over with eight reps per set for a few weeks. Then when I had nothing left, I started over with 10 reps per set until I maxed out, then I went back to the six reps and started over. I was a desperate man, because desperate men do desperate things.\nDuring the meet I watched Bill bench close grip. I thought “Is he playing me or does he known what he is talking about?” Well, I took my raw bench to a 450 touch-and-go at 175 pounds. And by 1977 I made a 500 touch-and-go at a 197-pound body weight. I will always be grateful to Bill for those wide grips.\nAlso grateful to Larry P for telling me to work my triceps. I put the wide grip and the tricep work together and it worked. Larry told me to win at nationals I had to build a good bench to go along with me as well as a good squat and deadlift. He was right, because of those two men I made my first top 10 bench in 1980. It was 10 years of hard work, but Larry was right. I won my first national championship. It made it possible for me to make top 10 bench for 22 years at 54. I was sixth in the 220 weight class in 2002, and also made it possible for me to bench 505 when I was 63 at 217 body weight, and total 1883. What’s more important is that six men from 132 to 308 have held all-time world records in the bench press as well as the women. We all can have more muscles that account for successful bench pressing. As you can see, there is more than one way to achieve greatness. There are a lot of you who think you know Westside, but as Rowdy Roddy Piper would say, “Just when you think you know all the answers, that’s when I change all the questions.”\nLouie Simmons",

The squat is an exercise that allows an individual to strengthen their legs, back, and trunk and can provide a myriad of strength and athletic benefits depending on how the exercise is performed and programmed. Whether you are a football player looking to improve sports performance or a powerlifter seeking to add pounds to your total, the barbell squat can be programmed to deliver the desired training results. The Conjugate Method provides a template allowing the barbell squat to be utilized in many ways. At Westside, we perform squats in one of three ways: during max, dynamic, and repeated effort training. The selected squat exercises can range from a basic barbell or SSB squat to giant cambered bar box squats with forward-pulling bands. A squat variation is a tool, and how we choose to utilize that tool dictates the training outcomes we can expect.\nHowever, to attain expected training results, the athlete must be able to perform a barbell squat proficiently. Failure to execute squat exercises with optimal form leads to reduced training effectiveness, an increased risk of overuse injuries, and an increased risk of catastrophic injury. As you can see, the squat is a rewarding exercise when performed correctly, but it can set an athlete back if performed without proper form and intent. At Westside, we have taught and corrected squat techniques for many athletes seeking to improve their lower body strength, explosive power, muscle mass, and endurance. The Anatomy of a Squat\nThe barbell squat is an exercise that involves and challenges many different muscle groups. This is what makes the squat such an effective exercise: the ability to target multiple muscle groups simultaneously while performing a basic barbell movement. Here are the major muscle groups involved in a barbell squat:\nAnterior Chain:\nQuadriceps\nAbdominals / Trunk\nHip Flexors\nPosterior Chain:\nGlutes\nHamstrings\nCalves\nErector Spinae\nAs you can see, the squat trains all the essential lower-body muscle groups efficiently and effectively. This simple barbell exercise is an incredibly valuable training tool for all athletes. No matter the sport you’re preparing for, there is no doubt all of these above-listed muscle groups play a significant role in the execution of basic sports movements. At Westside, we utilize a variety of specialty barbells and special exercises to target each of the above-listed muscle groups most effectively. These exercises are included to improve the overall technical mastery of the squat while placing specific emphasis on anterior or posterior muscle groups. These exercises enhance squat strength and coordination and help to build a complete athlete. Basic Squat Execution\nWhen thinking about squat execution, it is essential to remember that no two athletes will squat or perform any lift the same way. For this reason, effective squat coaching is achieved by providing movement guidelines and parameters instead of strict rules that all athletes must follow without considering biomechanical advantages and disadvantages. Barbell lifts are best coached by providing an athlete with basic instructions that can be easily followed while leaving room for the athlete to find their groove and move most efficiently. Remember that no matter how well-educated or capable a coach is, nobody knows how an athlete should move more than the athlete. Proprioception plays a tremendous role in technical mastery; only the athlete knows how they feel under the barbell. Here are the basic guidelines we use to coach the barbell squat at Westside Barbell:\nFirst, ensure the rack elevates the barbell to the proper height for a comfortable unrack. For most athletes, this will be the height that places the barbell in the middle of the chest as you walk up to the bar.\nNext, set the hands up properly. We recommend that athletes set their hands wide enough for the torso to remain as vertical as possible throughout the movement. The width of the grip will ultimately be determined by the width of the athlete’s back and the shoulder mobility they possess. Now that the hands have been properly set, we can bring the torso underneath the barbell and set the barbell on the back. This can be done one of two ways - high bar or low bar. Where you place the barbell will largely depend on your trunk and torso size. Typically, leaner athletes benefit from using the high bar position, considering stability and lack of torso lean associated with high bar squatting. Larger athletes can choose to squat high bar or low bar. Large athletes typically benefit from increased trunk and torso size when using a low bar position, allowing for the spinal flexion and torso lean created by the low bar position to be more tolerable. Low bar also gives a large athlete a biomechanical advantage over the barbell, considering the differing hip and knee flexion levels associated with high bar and low bar squatting. Once you have determined how to carry the barbell, it is time to unrack it. Unracking the barbell to squat will differ depending on whether you use a typical squat rack or a monolift. You must unrack and walk the weight out to complete your set when using a basic squat rack. This means an athlete must stabilize, unrack the barbell, walk the barbell out, restabilize, and complete the movement. To do this most efficiently, we want to unrack the barbell with our torso braced as much as possible. Then, we want to take as few steps as necessary to walk the bar out. Two steps are preferable, but if it takes a few extra steps to get your feet set, so be it. Once the feet are set, the athlete will restabilize as much as possible. When using a monolift all we have to worry about is bracing properly and unracking the barbell. With the monolift, there is no need to be concerned about walking out the weight and finding our foot placement, considering we can place our feet properly before standing up with the barbell. Now that we have unracked the barbell, it is time to initiate the eccentric portion of the squat. The first move should be a slight sit back of the hips to reduce the amount of forward knee travel as we descend. This is not a significant sitting back of the hips, just a slight movement rearward to give the knee joint and quads a break and maximize the use of the hips, glutes, and hamstrings. As we sit the hips back, we will simultaneously break at the knees to lower the barbell. During the descent, maintaining a torso as vertical as possible with the trunk adequately braced is critical. The torso position will ensure we maintain control of the barbell, while the trunk brace will act as the brake pad once we transition to the concentric portion of the squat. While lowering the barbell, we want to maintain a vertical shin position by opening the knees up as much as necessary, depending on the width of our stance. This will help ensure efficient lateral and vertical force transfer to the barbell, creating a stronger and more explosive squat movement. Once we have completed the eccentric phase of the squat, it is time to reverse the weight and complete the concentric phase of the lift. Provided you have followed the above advice, all that should be left to do is apply adequate force and move the barbell back to the starting position. As the exercise is completed, we will maintain our trunk brace and control the barbell as we return it to the rack. The Benefits of Squatting\nThe squat may be the most beneficial movement for all athletes out of the big three barbell lifts. Aside from the deadlift, which can cause issues with fatigue if performed too often, no other barbell lift challenges as many major muscle groups as the squat. Not only does the squat make an athlete bigger and stronger, but it does so rapidly and efficiently. When you program a squat or squat variation into your training program, you can guarantee you won’t waste your time. At Westside, we use the squat and its many variations to make athletes bigger, stronger, faster, and better conditioned. When considering the number of squat variations and the ability to adjust volume and intensity to manipulate the training effect further, you can see how the squat is a Swiss Army knife-type exercise. The greatest benefit is that squatting will improve lower body absolute strength. As an athlete, it is vital to increase the absolute strength you possess constantly. Absolute strength is the king of all strengths and determines your maximum strength, power, speed, and endurance. This is achieved by regularly including squat variations during max effort lower training. The next benefit of squatting is developing lower body explosive power. At Westside, we use the squat and its many variations to perform dynamic effort lower body training. This is done using a three-week wave format, training at specific intensity levels to achieve optimal barbell velocity. The final benefit of squatting is developing lower body muscle mass and endurance. At Westside, we use the repeated effort method when performing our accessory work. Often, if an athlete lacks lower body muscle mass or work capacity, we program accessory squat work at moderate to high volume and moderate to low intensity. The squat is an excellent tool to build muscle and improve conditioning, considering the number of muscle groups involved and the energy required to perform multiple multi-rep sets. Common Squat Mistakes Depending on your level of experience, you can make various mistakes when performing a barbell squat. However, almost every athlete makes a few common mistakes regardless of their level of strength or experience. The effectiveness of your squat training depends on your ability to avoid errors and perform technically proficient repetitions, so it is essential to know what habits to avoid when squatting. Here are a few of the most common squat mistakes we have seen athletes make over the years:\nWeak Unrack: This occurs when an athlete sets their rack height incorrectly or fails to brace properly before lifting the barbell out of the squat rack. Either way, a weak unrack will cause immediate instability in the squat setup and typically result in poor execution. With the squat, you finish as well as you start, so a poorly managed unrack can lead to disaster. Weak Brace: This can occur before or after lifting the barbell from the rack. A weak brace means what it says: your brace is weak or nonexistent. This happens due to improper breathing, with the athlete failing to create adequate intra-abdominal pressure. A weak brace will also lead to our next common squat mistake. Excessive Torso Lean: This mistake occurs when an athlete fails to brace correctly or does not have the strength to control the barbell properly. This results in the torso leaning forward, placing significant strain on the lower back. When this happens, the athlete will look like they are performing a good morning instead of a proper barbell squat.\nCollapsing Chest: This can occur due to poor bar placement or a weak upper back. A collapsing chest in the squat means the shoulders are rolled forward, placing great strain on the neck and upper back. This results in a loss of control over the eccentric portion of the lift and can lead to thoracic or cervical spine injury. Collapsing Knees: This occurs when the knees excessively collapse inward as an athlete applies force out of the hole to complete the concentric phase of the lift. This can occur due to weak hips, a poor trunk brace, or improper squat stance width. When left unchecked, collapsing knees can lead to catastrophic injury. Frequently Asked Questions Q: What is the proper way to use air to brace during a squat?\nA: We want to breathe in deeply, using the air to expand the diaphragm and create adequate intra-abdominal pressure. When done correctly, your trunk will feel rigid and stable without feeling like you’re holding your breath. When done incorrectly, you will feel the air pressure in the chest and face, with the trunk and torso remaining noticeably unstable. Q: Should I wear a belt when squatting?\nA: We recommend wearing a belt when performing a standard squat workout. However, if you are completely new to squatting, we do recommend training with lighter weights and no belt to develop fundamental movement skills without the assistance of a belt\nQ: Should I wear knee sleeves or wraps when squatting?\nA: Knee sleeves can be worn during any squat or lower body exercise. However, we typically save knee wraps for max effort training or if we plan on performing high or ultra-high rep squat sets and need additional assistance and support. Q: Box squats or free squats?\nA: At Westside, we perform all our dynamic effort squats to a box. With max effort squatting, we will perform a mix of free and box squats. The key is to perform as many free squats during max effort training as necessary to remain proficient in competition-relevant movements. Q: What squat exercise variations are most commonly used at Westside Barbell?\nA: We most often use the back squat, front squat, box squat, and squat vs. bands using a typical squat bar, safety squat bar, buffalo bar, or giant cambered bar. Find Your Form\nFinding optimal form is one of the most critical aspects of successful barbell training. An athlete must take the time to practice the different barbell movements and see what setups and techniques work best for them as an individual. The idea that there are one-size-fits-all rules to barbell lifts is nonsense and disregards what we know about human biodiversity and biomechanics. No two athletes are the same. It is vital to develop techniques that make the most of all the biomechanical advantages an athlete may have while avoiding techniques that complicate the lift for the athlete. The goal is an efficient and effective movement pattern that provides optimal training while protecting the athlete from injury as much as possible. Finding the form and technique that works best for you is integral to your success in the gym. You do not want to waste time using techniques that are either ineffective, place you at a disadvantage, or increase the risk of injury. Don’t fall victim to one-size-fits-all approaches to barbell training form and technique. Do the work, develop your style, and reap the benefits of optimal squat training. Sources:\nSimmons, L.

Biological tissues are stress responsive tissues which have the capacity to self organize and self repair. For example, when a stressor is inputted into the system, the tissues will self organize and self repair to better handle that specific stressor. The process of increasing capacity as a result of specific stressors is a biological principle known as the SAID Principle (Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands).\nDuring the self repair process, the body will overcompensate (up to the individual’s biological limit); thus, increasing the capacity of those tissues to better withstand that stressor in the future. The body overcompensates in the repair process as it believes that that same stressor will occur in the future; however, the stressor will be worse; thus, capacity is increased.\nAcute training/manual therapy stressors aid in enabling the body to increase capacity to better handle stressors in the future. If stressor inputs are removed from biological systems, the body will decrease capacity and become fragile and weak. “Your body is a process. It starts when you’re born, ends when you die. Everything in between requires work.” Dr. Andreo Spina Optimal stressor inputs function as information to the complex system to overcompensate and develop increased capacity so that the organism is a better match for the demands being placed upon them. Thus, the absence of stressor inputs in biological systems is harmful.\nA bank account does not have the capacity to self repair. Thus, when a withdraw is made (stressor) the account is harmed from the event.\nSadly, individuals in the training/rehabilitation, manual therapy fields do not grasp basic biological principles or complex systems. Because of this ignorance, trainers/therapists remove vital stressors from individuals, which hurts the system as a whole making the individual fragile and perpetuates the injury process.\nThanks to Dr. Michael Chivers who exposed me to complex systems and Donella Meadows book: Thinking in Systems.\nJohn Quint NMT, FR, FRCms, ART, CAFS",

It is very important to max out as often as possible, as you know this was the method the world renown Bulgarians used that produced Naim Suleymanoglu. The Olympic champion Vomi Zatsiorsky says the maximal effort method is superior to all others for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordination.\nWhy?\nThe muscles and CNS adapt only to the load placed on them. The max-effort workout calls for working up to a new max even by five pounds a month. This would add up to 60 pounds a year. For the first, the snatch-grip deadlift, use straps as the weights grow to a max, if needed. Stand on the floor and work up to a max single.\nThe Soviets and Westside only count an all-time record. This accounts for about 600 new records in a yearly plan. The Bulgarians would count the largest possible weights on a daily basis. That could amount to 4,000 lifts in their yearly plan.\nThe second special exercise is the power clean with straight legs and not allowing the bar to touch the body. You must keep records on all lifts, and always break a record. Remember, don’t get greedy, get a small record and move on to the new special exercises.\nThe third special exercise is a high-box squat where you can handle about 100 pounds over your best full squat. One can max out on a back, front or overhead squat. If you like, use a power rack and set the pins, then crawl under the bar and squat the weight off a set pin high for a record.\nFor the snatch grip deadlift and straight leg muscle up and power clean you can stand on a two-inch or four-inch box for a greater variety of possible special barbell exercises. Don’t worry about your technique as special barbell exercises have no ill effect on coordination, timing or sporting technique. You must get accustomed to lifting all-time records constantly in training.\nThe exercises must switch each week to avoid the law of accommodation. It was the basic theory of the Bulgarian team, but with less special exercise. Westside uses many special exercises and methods to switch from. This was the Soviet method, so Westside’s method is a mixture of both the Russian and Bulgarian systems.\nLouie More Olympic Max Effort Workouts\nLet’s look at isometric training. In the 1960s isometric training was very popular due to Bob Hoffman, the founder of the famous York Barbell Club, plus names like Bill March, Phil Grippaldi and the rest of the York gang. Isometrics were done in a special rack. It was designed to lift a barbell at a set position on a pin and lifter concentrically to a second pin and held for three to six seconds.\nThis was known as the Hoffman method. Isometric means constant length. This is a plus as it caused little inflammation due to no eccentric or concentric actions. Isometric actions will radiate 15 degrees in both directions. This means for all cleans, snatches or deadlifts six positions can be utilized.\nFor the Olympic lifts it is common to do holds at floor level, mid-shin, at knee and at the second pull position. One of the four mentioned York lifters, Joe Dube was the last U.S. lifter to win a world championship in 1968. Coincidence or training methods? Joe was very strong and isometrics is how absolute strength is measured.\nNow the workout: Start at floor level and pull on a non-moveable bar for three sets of five exertions for three to five seconds. Next, repeat at mid-shin, then above knee and finally at top of thigh or second pull position. This accounts for 60 max efforts with a clean or snatch grip. Note: this is a plus for a coach or your training partner to analyze your technique. After initially starting to pull on the barbell, pull yourself into perfect pulling position to best utilize the correct muscles at those precise angles. Westside recommends maximum exertions on each repetition. It is very important to train all realms of muscle actions eccentric, concentric and static.\nNow it is time to lift a loaded barbell from floor level up to a preset pin at knee level, above knee or at second pull position and hold the barbell against the pin for three to five seconds. Always try to hold heavier weight against the pins with perfect form. Squats and presses have also been employed in other workouts. Explosive movements like jumping can finish the workout. Isometric training has said not to be used on novices, but Westside has trained 16-year-old track girls isometrically with only positive results. Y.V. Verkhoshansky notes the pro’s and con’s of training isometrically.\nPRO’S One only uses a barbell and a power rack. If training only floor level, load a barbell to a weight you cannot move and perform the isometrics.\nOne can train at specific joint angles.\nIt takes little time to do the sets.\nThere is no increase in muscle mass.\nIt is easy to perfect form and builds the kinesthetic retention in the positions needed in the dynamic regime. CON’S Isometric exercises can fatigue the CNS. and can be stressful on the cardiovascular system.\nIf only isometrics are used, one can lose coordination and speed of movement and possibly lose the elasticity of the muscle. This means to do active work after isometrics, and use proper uniform breathing and do relaxation after workouts. For more sample max effort workouts look below. Here is a list of fundamental special strength exercises in groups for rotating workouts for max effort.\nWorkouts for the Snatch Power snatch with barbell above knee in starting position. Power snatch standing on a box. Squat by lowering 80 percent slowly and raising fast with 60ercent. Use weight releases or have spotters strip 20 percent off bar before rising as fast as possible.\nPower Snatch, leg straight, lean over. Snatch pull from the floor. Snatch pull up to knee level. Push jerk.\nThree-phase snatch, pull snatch pull, pull snatch pull, from below knees. Plus, snatch pull from above knees. Snatch pull plus classic snatch. Overhead squat with snatch grip.\nPush-jerk from behind head plus squat. Power clean from above knees six-inch box squat with long relaxed pause.\nHalf-jerk plus full jerk off stands. Power clean standing on box. Power clean then squat. Power clean squat then jerk.\nHigh box squat at least 100 pounds over best front or back squat. Work up to max five reps in arched back Goodmorning power clean with bar at top of legs off boxes or pins. Always push back raise, calf ham-glute raise up in volume and intensity. Belt squat or pull weight sled. The above is just an example of workouts for max effort. Always note each week and keep careful records and break new records. Remember, even if you break a power clean record by five pounds a month, it is 60 pounds a year. This is easy to do when you choose the correct rotation. Why work up to 85 or 90 percent of a one-rep max when you can consistently lift over 100 percent just like the Bulgarians?\nA sample week Speed squat and pulls thru max effort Sunday.\nSmall special exercises for back and legs Monday.\nMax effort Tuesday.\nPlus two to four small GPP workouts during the week.

It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”\nMark Twain The most effective training method to optimize lifting mechanics for compound movements (deadlift, squat, press, etc.) is Maximal Effort (ME) Method. There is an inaccurate thought process that lifting maximal weights is unsafe. This thought process is normally that of the physical therapist who weighs 100lbs and spends his time posting videos on Instagram practicing movements or the out of shape strength coach who is unable to deadlift his own body weight. In theory one can argue (incorrectly) that ME method is “unsafe”; however, the fact of the matter is in practice ME method is the best method to optimize the efficiency for compound movements. “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.”\nYogi Berra The most efficient way to optimize lifting mechanics is to SUBTRACT the ways in which the lift can be accomplished.Since lifting light weights is easy, the body can formulate almost an infinite number of movement solutions that will accomplish the task. For example, if you squat down and pick up a 10lb kettlebell there are literally thousands of different movement solutions, with endless combination of options that would accomplish the task. You could be on one leg, or you could be on your tiptoes, etc. If you performed this light lift repeatedly, you would use your joints in combinations that you may possibly never use again.\nSimply, lifting light weights enables the body to formulate more movement solutions, which increases the complexity; thus, decreasing the odds of improving mechanics or using optimal mechanics. Experienced lifters who train compound movements with heavy weights understand this concept; that is why their heavier sets “feel” and generally look better. Their non working warm up sets will not be as mechanically efficient as their heavier working sets, as they can get away with not being 100% on point. Once the weight gets heavier, the body narrows down movement solutions; thus, optimizing lifting mechanics.\nThe body is an adaptable biological complex system, which in this scenario gains knowledge by subtraction, NOTaddition. By examining ME method through a systems perspective, we can see the load acts as a resistance to the musculoskeletal component part of the system. As the load increases, resistance increases which decreases the amount of movement solutions that will accomplish the lift. Thus, as the load increases it acts to assist the central nervous system component part of the biological complex system by narrowing the range of options (movement solutions).\nTraining compound lifts using ME method narrows the movement solutions down to very fundamental and powerful mechanics. For instance the mechanics of picking up a 10lb kettlebell is going to look very different from the mechanics of deadlifting 315lbs of weight with 200lbs of band tension. Therefore, if the aim of training is enhance lifting mechanics (which it should be), Maximum Effort Method must be applied. “The method of maximal effort is considered superior for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordinations; the muscles and central nervous system (CNS) apart only to the load placed on them. This should be used to bring forth the greatest strength increments.”\nZatsiorsky, Science and Practice of of Strength Training In both Science and Practice, the ME method is superior for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. Simply put, muscles are composed of muscle fibers which are under the control of motor neurons. This relationship when viewed from a systems perspective is referred to as the neuromuscular system. Lifting maximal weights enhances the performance of the neuromuscular system by removing movement solutions for which the system can formulate, thus optimizing lifting mechanics and enhancing long-term potentiation**.\nI was exposed to the method of maximal effort by Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell. I am beyond grateful for all I have learned from Lou, Tom Barry and all the individuals at Westside Barbell.\nJohn Quint NMT, FR, FRCms, ART, CAFS\n**In neuroscience, long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. There are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. > “Cells that fire together, wire together.”",

We encourage you to continually expand your knowledge base by learning from books, DVD’s and other media sources written ONLY by well-recognized, credible experts. The Westside Barbell program is based on tested and proven training methods. It is not a fly-by-night ‘add 6” to your vertical jump in 2 weeks’ scam. Also be wary of ABC Trainer Certificates that have flooded the market. Only a few, such as the Westside Barbell Special Strength Certificate, which is NSCA CEU approved are worthy of spending money from your budget. Be very wary of anything that sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Westside Barbell has a very strong passion for helping athletes of all ages reach their genetic potential. Hence, the Westside Barbell System for Sports. We hope that you, your staff and your athletes find the information contained helpful and easy to follow. The Westside Barbell System for Sports program guideline is completely based on Westside Barbell training methods and protocols. It is written for all sport programs, male and female. In this guideline you will find detailed scientific explanation of the methods used, recommendations for in-season and off-season programming, weekly planning and more. The Westside Barbell System of Training When most people look at Westside Barbell training protocols, they automatically think of powerlifting. But the truth is that the Westside program is used in track and field, football, soccer, basketball, wrestling, volleyball and additional sport programs at all levels, across the globe. From the NFL to the Hong Kong Rugby Club. Louie Simmons is especially proud to have a picture of Johnny Parker from the New England Patriots and Kent Johnston from the Green Bay Packers, Strength & Conditioning Coaches, on the field of the Louisiana Superdome at Super Bowl XXXI. Both clubs spent a week at Westside Barbell and followed up with additional consultation to implement Westside Barbell programs into their training. Five major rugby teams from Europe and Australia have made the long flight to visit Westside and have since achieved phenomenal results. Countless sport programs, along with Pro Boxers, MMA fighters and wrestlers/grapplers have used the Westside system to produce speed, explosive strength and reduce injuries. The Westside Barbell method of training will allow the coaching staff to record athletic speed and strength levels every week, in-season and out of season. It will also give the coaching staff valuable real-time feedback on which anatomical weaknesses require development and/or types of strength that needs to be focused on while training individual athletes. The Westside system is simple yet extremely effective. Its core system requires athletes to train a minimum of four days per week, but can be modified to accommodate those programs limited to three or two days per week. In this segment, the Westside Barbell programming will be explained using the traditional four day per week system. Later we will explain how to adapt this into three or two day per week programs for those with time and weight room accessibility constraints. Training Day 1 – Max Effort Method, Lower Body\nTraining Day 2 – Max Effort Method, Upper Body\nTraining Day 3 – Dynamic Effort Method, Lower Body\nTraining Day 4 – Dynamic Effort Method, Upper Body Note: 72 hours of rest is needed between Max Effort and Dynamic Effort days for Lower Body or Upper Body for optimum recovery. 12-24 hours between small workouts such as restoration, G.P.P., and agility work (all explained later) is suggested for optimum recovery. Maximum Effort Training To become more explosive, one must constantly become stronger This is the greatest method of strength training for improving both intermuscular and intramuscular coordination, as your body only adapts to the load placed on it. Begin to use this method after a warm-up to single attempts until setting a new personal record. Stop for the day after this is achieved. Seven days later switch to a special barbell exercise and max out once more. This is low volume, high intensity training followed by three or four special exercises. The Westside Barbell program requires your athletes to perform a 1 rep maximal lift on a special squat, rack deadlift, clean/snatch variation or elevated deadlift standing on a 2” or 4” box. What does “max out” mean? Simply work up to a max single repetition. On Maximum Effort Day, Good Mornings can also be done in any style; arched back, bent over, wide stance, close stance or seated. NOTE: Never go below 3 repetitions for any variation of the Good Morning exercise. Use appropriate weight for three or more reps only. It is very important to switch your max effort exercise each week as doing so prevents accommodation, and it will also provide new training stimulus to keep your athletes from getting bored or stale. It is recommended to find and stick with six to eight max effort movements and rotate between the chosen movements accordingly. Choose exercises that the vast majority of your athletes are weak at, not able to use heavier weights and set goals to improve upon each exercise throughout the year. Convey to your athletes that there is more benefit in strengthening their weak areas than improving their strong areas. Every eight weeks we recommend testing Regular Squats, Bench Presses and Deadlifts to view progress and to update correct percentages for Dynamic Effort Day. Following the maximum effort main exercise will be the special accessory work. Dynamic Effort Training The Dynamic Method is sometimes referred to as speed work. There are some who think it is not necessary to work on speed, however this is just one part of the total strength equation. One day a couple lifters and I were having a discussion about the training philosophies of Dr. Y. V. Verkhoshansky. I explained to them that Dr. Verkoshansky is an expert on power metrics, or the entire collection of jumping, rebounding and shock training. While some refer to me as a weight lifting expert, you cannot compare our methods at all. That’s when I knew not to loan a single book to anyone; it leads to confusion. Let’s look at the purpose of the Dynamic Method, or training with submaximal weights with maximal speed. This system builds a fast rate of force development. With bands and chains added, it teaches one to accelerate and reduce bar deceleration. With the lighter weights, one can control and perfect form. For more explosive strength, one can do ballistic bench pressing. This method consists of lowering the barbell as fast as possible and catching and reversing the bar just before it touches the chest. Do not allow the bar to touch the chest. Press the bar to lockout as powerfully as possible. The Dynamic Method was also used to replace a Maximal Effort method for those who could not handle a second high- intensity or 95% 1RM and above workout twice in the same week. If you do extremely heavy workouts twice a week, you can suffer from law of accommodation. This simply means, if you handle the same weight loads and the same training percentages, your performance will go backwards. Dynamic Effort lifts involve moving a submaximal weight with maximal speed. This method is not used for maximal strength because it is impossible to obtain Fmm (Maximal Force) with fast movements while using intermediate resistance. Its purpose is to improve a faster rate of force development and explosive strength. For speed-strength, add 25% band tension at the top for accommodating resistance; this helps to eliminate bar deceleration. After a three-week wave, add band tension or loading weight by adding chain to the bar. One should change bars regularly if possible or change the width of the stance or grip. One could even change bar placement from a front position to a high bar squats, such as overhead squats if they can be performed with good technique. The bands will force you down faster than just the weight alone, causing an increase in kinetic energy. This is the key to reversal strength. Repeated Effort Training After the Dynamic Method or Maximal Effort Method workout, an athlete must follow up with three or four small exercises. Size, strength endurance and restoration can all be achieved through implementing the repetition method. It is a simple, yet highly effective way to raise work capacity and volume to increase a lift total. If explosive strength work is needed, then more jumping, bounding and depth jumps should be added to an athlete’s routine. Special accessory work should be the largest volume of training, accounting for 75% to 80% of the total training volume. On both days, Maximal Effort and Dynamic Effort, special exercises must be done for the lower back, hamstrings, glutes, hips, upper back and of course the abdominals. At Westside Barbell, we perform a heavy amount of rowing exercises using bars, dumbbells or plates for upright rows and shrugs for the upper back. Reverse Hypers, Back Raises (45-degree Hyper) and/or light Good Mornings for high reps will follow the upper back exercises. Inverse Curls or Glute/Ham Raises for high reps, Prone Leg Curls with bands or ankle weights would be next for hamstring development. You must recover between workouts. One training day is high volume and moderate intensity with very quick muscle contraction and considering that the Maximal Effort day can be stressful on the Central Nervous System (CNS), the GPP (General Physical Preparedness) must be high. Westside Barbell Program: Weekly Plan Overview Note: Each training session should last no longer than 45 minutes to 1 hour. Lower Body Day 1 Upper Body Day 2 Lower Body Day 3 Upper Body Day 4 1 Maximal Effort Movement 1 Maximal Effort Movement 1 Dynamic Effort Movement 1 Dynamic Effort Movement Work up to 1 rep max on any of these exercises with exception of Good Mornings, never less than 3- 5 reps Work up to 1 rep max Choose any form of box squat and add: Week 1 – 50% Week 2 – 55% Week 3 – 60% of the athlete’s 1 Rep squat max on the given exercise in straight weight, then add 25% of accommodating resistance (bands or chains) on top of the straight weight for: 10 sets of 2 reps Rest only 45 seconds between sets. Choose any form of Bench Press movement and add: Week 1 – 50% Week 2 – 55% Week 3 – 60% Of the athlete’s 1 rep bench press on the given exercise in straight weight, then add 25% of accommodating resistance (bands or chains) on top of the straight weight for 9setsof3reps Rest only 45 seconds Between sets Choose from: Choose From: Immediately proceed to: Note:  Good Morning (any variations for 3-5 rep max, NEVER 1 rep max for this exercise)  Sumo Deadlift standing on a 2” or 4” rubber mat  Safety Squat Bar Box Squat (make sure to squat to parallel)  Cambered Squat Bar Box Squat  Conventional Stance Rack Deadlift from pin  Bow Bar Box Squat  Zercher Squat  Football Bar Bench Press  Floor Press  Seated Overhead Press  Cambered Bench Bar Press  Max Repetition Push- ups in a rack off a bar with weight 6-8 sets of 2 reps of Speed Deadlifts with 50% of the Deadlift Max in straight weight and 25% of accommodating resitance (bands or chains) Change grip on the bar every 3 Sets.

The first phase of this system stimulates muscle hypertrophy and is followed by the power phase where strength is increased by lifting intermediate weights while using maximum acceleration. Unfortunately, 14 to 21 days into this phase, the muscle mass gained during the first phase begins to atrophy. Following the power phase is the maximal strength phase; whereby the weights being lifted become increasingly heavier as a contest nears. Therefore, abandoning the power phase for 14 to 21 days can stunt or lessen strength development. Thus, the progressive gradual overload system has set a lifter up for failure! Completing all the phases of this system causes an athlete to lose the volume of training needed to lift a new all-time max. Meet day is when special strength qualities are really needed; however due to this faulty training system an individual has less muscle, less bar speed and a lack of training volume necessary to produce a new personal best lift. The progressive gradual overload system and other incorrect training methods have proven to be inferior to forms of wave periodization, such as the Westside Barbell Conjugate System. The progressive gradual periodization system will have an eerily similar negative effect on athletes, causing muscular atrophy and loss of speed and acceleration and must be avoided completely in-season and out-of-season. Jumping Jumping is a very crucial part of speed development, but resistance must be used to be most effective for athletes that have a reached a high GPP. Jumps should be performed with ankle weights, weighted vests, kettlebells or any combination of the three. Jumping twice per week will work best for most athletes. Record starting box jump height personal bests with various amounts of resistance and encourage athletes to establish a new personal record each workout. In addition to jumps from a standing position, have an athlete sit on a low 12” high box, similar to the one used for box squatting. Have the athlete rock back swinging the arms to the rear while lifting the feet off the ground. Follow this with a swing of the arms forward while slamming the feet to the floor to initiate the jump to the box. The same technique works for a long jump. To mix it up and provide additional resistance, have the athlete stand on a piece of thick foam and jump. This simulates jumping out of sand. A Basic Jump Program Begin with a group of jumping exercises that initially came from Dance and was later incorporated into Weight Lifting and Track & Field:  From a kneeling squat position, rock forward and backward then jump to the feet  From a kneeling squat position, power clean a bar from the floor while jumping to the feet  From a kneeling squat position, power snatch a bar from the floor while jumping to the feet  From a kneeling squat position, power clean or power snatch a bar from the floor while jumping to the feet and landing in a split squat stance Note: Add weights as athletes progress in strength while maintaining proper form and technique. Record weights and keep records on each type of jump. As athletes become stronger, initiate box jumping with weights. Use Kettlebells, Weight Vests, Ankle Weights and combinations of any or all of these items. Rotate these items each workout to avoid accommodation. You may allow 40 jumps per workout for the very strong and advanced athletes 17 years of age or older. Weaker and younger athletes should be limited to 15 to 20 or fewer jumps per session. To round out the preparatory phase, power walk with sleds. This will build strong jumping and running muscles as well as thicker ligaments and tendons where many season or career ending injuries occur. Westside Barbell DVD’s cover all of this info on volume and intensity. The coach and the athlete must learn to train smarter, not harder. When the stage of progression is reached on the Jump Program, an athlete is ready for plyometric training. All ‘shock’ methods can be taxing, plyometrics are no different. Before performing any forms of Depth Jumps, let’s look at several types of bounding with ground contact under two- tenths of a second:  Single-leg take-offs on stairs  Leg-to-leg jumps; single, triple, 5’s and 10’s  Double-leg jumps over 5-10 or 15 low hurdles  Double leg jumps over high hurdles of 40-42”  Slow bounds with submaximal effort in a controlled style  Frog jumps  3 jumps off left foot then 3 jumps off right foot  20/40/60 meter leg-to-leg bounds with light resistance of 10, 20 or 30 lbs. using a Bulgarian Bag  Standing long jumps (keep records)  Standing long jumps with kettlebells (released before landing) The jumps listed above should be done after a 30 minute rest following the barbell workouts on Dynamic and Max Effort days. Westside Barbell heavily utilizes soft surfaces such as thick foam pads for squats and jumps. This causes the muscles to do more of the work and not limit it to the ligaments and tendons. In two out of three workouts we will step down off the box onto other boxes. On the third workout, and highest box, we do a depth jump down onto a soft gym mat. We do not do an immediate jump upon landing. Rather we will just ‘stick it’ with legs slightly bent, landing on the balls of the feet. The goal is to jump as high as possible and, therefore, squat as much as possible. We squat and jump in the same way, off a box. Before jumping or squatting, we sit on a box at parallel, relax and then jump or squat upwards. This requires a much greater effort and will produce much better results in regards to explosive legs. The forces that produce movement are external, internal and reactive strengths. This was established by Bernstein (Verkhoshansky, 1986). When lowering onto a box, a greater amount of kinetic energy is expressed because mass as well as speed contribute to kinetic energy. Landing on the biggest part of the lower body will yield an increase in kinetic energy. In addition, by lifting the feet and slamming them onto the floor to initiate the jump, an overspeed eccentric phase occurs. This combination very effectively increases jumping power. Several NFL linemen I have trained have set PR’s in their long jump in one or two of these jumping sessions. Very Important Note to Always Remember: Jumping can be very taxing; you MUST first build a base, which is the next topic, Sled Work. Sled Work\nPower Walking with the sled is the Tai Chi of speed and strength training. To build a fast and strong sprinter or jumper, we must first have an athlete use long strides with the feet close to the ground and using the heels to pull the body and sled forward. This will powerfully build the hips, glutes, hamstrings and calves. Sixty yards works best for sprinting and for football players’ 40 times. Complete 8 trips of 60 yards with heavy weight on the first day. Reduce the weight by 33% and increase the number of trips to 10 to 15 on second day after a day in between sled workouts. Reduce the weight to one or two 45 pound plates for a couple warm-up trips on the third day. The first day builds absolute strength, the second day builds strength for dynamic endurance and the third day is for a warm-up or restoration, not needing a rest day prior to this. Around 1994 I wondered why the Finns were dominating the world at deadlifting. Knowing they were very athletic, there had to be another reason as well. My good friend Eskil Thomasson from Sweden was visiting us at Westside Barbell. He was going back to Sweden for a visit before moving to Westside for ten years. When he went to Finland, he asked why they were all great deadlifters. To his surprise, they had no idea. Some were lumberjacks and would pull the logs out by hand and chain to the road for the tractor to pick them up. They used several ways to pull the logs. One way was to pull them backwards; some would walk forward; others would pull over the shoulder. All in all, the key was heavy manual labor, but it added up to a lot of log pulling. On hearing this, I started pulling a tire at first and then sleds, very heavily at times, around 450 pounds for 100 feet for three or four trips. It worked extremely well and it was the birth of sled pulling now used by countless athletic programs. Using 225 pounds for six trips of 60 yards works great for powerlifters, sprinters and football players. It can be done three times per week, weather permitting. Westside Barbell programming includes sled work in hot and cold elements, providing the surface we are pulling on is exposed enough to provide resistance. Sled power walking will build all of the muscles in the lower body used for sprinting and jumping while increasing an athlete’s conditioning level at the same time. Don’t forget, you can work your upper body as well by using a second strap. Any movement can be performed;  Curls  Upright Rows  Triceps Extensions  Pec Work  Delt Work  Rotational Work  Pull-throughs  Good mornings (using a light weight on the sled) with a neck harness walking backwards slowly. Bend over and methodically stand erect, then walk backwards with tension at all times. This will stimulate the entire back region and strength the neck simultaneously. For sprinting technique, stay on the balls of your feet while performing sled work. You can assign the distance for an athlete based on the length of the race. Distance and marathon runners can get heart rates up to 190 bmp with proper sled work.Intensity may be increased by adding ankle weights, weight vests or both. For additional hamstring work, walk with the straps between your legs at knee level, walking with large steps. Switch sled pulling styles as often as you like to continuously stimulate the lower and/or upper body. Sled work will build phenomenal muscular development for speed exactly where it counts for all athletes. Accommodation\nWe must all learn and know what accommodation is. Accommodation causes performances to stagnate or decrease. This happens in the weight room and on the playing surface. Zatsiorsky stated that the response of a biological object to a given constant stimulus decreases over time. Another proven method of changing the amount of work being done is to change the length of rest time between sets. This is reflected by the intensity zone being used. Speed Strength rest intervals can vary from 30 to 90 seconds between sets. For circa-max weights, the rest can be 60 seconds to 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The max depends on an athletes’ GPP. Every time you change something and master its performance an athlete will become a BETTER athlete. Off-season Training Technically, there is never an off-season for a coach or an athlete. However in the period of time an athlete is not in competition it is of the utmost importance to focus on Absolute Strength, Dynamic Strength and Reactive/Explosive Strengths. In-season Training The in-season focus has to be on Dynamic Effort and Accessory work. It is very important to eliminate Maximal Effort as this is too heavy of a tax on the Central Nervous System for athletes involved in weekly contests. Only program a Maximal Effort workout during long periods of time between contests during the season. Limited Training Schedule, Availability and Resources If your schedule only allows your athletes to train 3 days in a week, you will have to merge both Dynamic Effort days together and select the exercises that will carry over best for your athletes. As a coach, you most likely don’t have the luxury of providing an individual program for each athlete. You also have to deal with high volumes of athletes. A good rule of thumb for overall development is to use the following:  Belt squats of all variations  Sled work of all variations  Dumbbell Presses  Reverse Hypers  Inverse Curls  Hip & Quad Development  Jumping These simple yet highly effective exercises along with Max Effort and Dynamic Effort movements are universal speed and strength developers and can be easily adjusted for athletes of all strength and fitness levels.

For speed strength training for the squat use a three-week pendulum wave. Seventy-five percent to 85 percent weights are used for squatting on speed strength day. Other weights are too fast to build strength, meaning under 70 percent. The very heavy squats should be done on max effort day.\nBelow is a sample squat for a 300-pound max:\nWeek 1: 75% = 225 lb, five sets of five reps, 25 lifts.\nWeek 2: 80% = 240 lb, five sets of five reps, 25 lifts.\nWeek 3: 85% = 255 lb, five sets of five reps, 25 lifts.\nWeek 4: 75% and repeat wave.\nHere is sample for a 600-pound max squat:\nWeek 1: 75%= 450 lb, five sets of five reps, 25 lifts.\nWeek 2: 80% = 480 lb, five sets of five reps, 25 lifts.\nWeek 3: 85% = 510 lb, five sets of five reps, 25 lifts.\nNext the Snatch and Clean and Jerk\nFor the average do 15 snatch and clean and jerk combinations for a three-week pendulum wave using 75, 80 and 85 percent for five sets of three reps in both lifts for a total of 15 lifts and the squats.\nAn example for a 300-pound snatch or clean and jerk\nWeek 1: 75% =225 lb, five sets of three reps, 15 lifts\nWeek 2: 80% = 240 lb, five sets of three reps, 15 lifts\nWeek 3: 85% = 255 lb, five sets of three reps, 15 lifts\nWeek 4: 75% = 225 lb, five sets of three reps, 15 lifts\nExample for a 400-pound clean and jerk.\nWeek 1: 75% = 300 lb, five sets of three reps, 15 lifts\nWeek 2: 80% = 320 lb, five sets of three reps, 15 lifts\nWeek 3: 85% = 340 lb, five sets of three reps, 15 lifts\nThis is the recommendation from A.S. Prilepin’s 1974 data.\nThe highest level lifter can do the max amount of lifts, which is 24 at 70 percent range and 20 at 80 percent range. This is a high-volume training day when the squats and pulls are combined. Remember, just do one weight per workout after a basic warmup.\nNext, special exercises must make up no less than 50 percent of your training. Westside suggests up to 80 percent small exercises must be done due to the fact that our weight lifters do not have the proper proportions.\nMeaning highest to weight ratios\nLet’s look at some workouts to choose from. A.S. Medvedyev had 62 such workouts for the snatch and clean and jerk, and total of 100 for improving the classical lifts. Remember to pick one snatch and one clean and jerk exercise per workout, 15 each.\nClean Exercises Power clean plus push jerk\nPower clean front squat\nPower clean front squat then jerk\nPower clean bar at knees\nPower clean bar at top of thigh\nPower clean standing on 2” or 4” box\nPower clean\nClassic clean\nClassic clean front squat plus jerk\nPower clean plus push jerk then jerk\nMuscle clean standing on a two-inch to four-inch box\nMuscle clean plus jerk. Note: do not touch body on muscle cleans. Snatch Exercises Power Snatch\nPower snatch plus overhead squat\nPower Snatch from knee level\nPower Snatch from below knee level\nClassical Snatch\nClassical snatch plus overhead squat\nClassical snatch standing on two-inch or four-inch box\nPower snatch with close grip\nPower snatch starting with leg straight\nMuscle snatch\nMuscle snatch plus overhead squat\nClassical snatch with holds at below and above knee level. Hold for a count of three. This is a random list to pick and choose from at your discretion.\nIf you choose to use accommodating resistance, use 50, 55 and 60 percent in your three-week waves with 25 percent over the barbell at the top of pull. Note: bar must be centered on the platform as to not disturb barbell trajectory. As you can see, this is a high-volume workout. By using so many different exercises you will avoid the law of accommodation, and your form will become better. The max effort workouts will build strength at the critical positions of the Olympic lifts. Both workouts will complement each other. Always push the small single joint exercises with more volume and heavier weights when possible.\n-Louie- Why Periodization?\nIf one strives to become a highly skilled athlete in today’s competitive sports world, their training must be organized. I hear someone asking for an eight to 12 or 16-week program. Training must be a multi-year plan. Stop to think, high school sports last four years, collegiate also lasts four years and the Olympics are every four years. That means training 52 weeks a year with only competitions breaking up training. An athlete must increase strength, power hypertrophy and endurance as well as perfecting his or her sporting forms. Wester periodization calls for training one task at a time. This type of training is really D training as when one move phase to the next to last block of training loses some of its merit.\nWestside used this type of training from 1970-1980. It then found the methods used by the Soviets. Even Verkhoshansky used out-dated training methods that retarded sporting progress. Westside found a system through much experimentation that raises maximal strength and speed strength while building hypertrophy or any special strength desired. It works by using the loading data by A.S. Prilepin and how to distribute the load correctly by A.D. Ermakov and N.S. Atanasov. They show 85 percentof weight should be used most often. This is Westside’s highest volume training weights. It is done in three-week pendulum waves repeated throughout the entire year, year after year. The three-week pendulum is trained at 75, 80 and 85 percent with 25 speed strength squats. This makes it easy to control the volume for a one rep max. The average intensity is 80 percent.\nExample:\n400 lb squat max= 25 times 320 = 8,000= 80%\n600 lb squat max= 25 times 480 = 12,000= 80%\n800 lb squat max= 25 times 640 = 16,000= 80%\nBy looking at the volume of an 800-pound max it is two times the volume of a 400-pound max. It is simple math. By knowing this no one will over or under train. Train at your current max, not a hypothetical max, because it is hypothetical at best.\nThe bar speed should be roughly .8m/s. For speed strength this has lead to six men holding world-record squats and 26 men over 1,000 pounds. Immediately after squats go to 80 percent of your one rep max deadlift and 20 lifts are in order. Most of Westside training is at 50, 55 and 60 percent bar weight with 25 percent at lockout in both the squat and deadlifts. This is accommodating resistance; it is much more productive than barbell weight alone.\nThis covers power and speed strength. Next is max effort.\nMax Effort\nSeventy-two hours later is max effort day. Westside works up to a new max each week and breaks a new all-time record at about a 95 percent rate. This system is a combination of the Russian Conjugate system when large and small special exercises are rotated. The large barbell exercises are rotated each week and the small special exercises about every three or four workouts. No notebooks; do it by feel meaning what you need most. When using a barbell exercise at 90 percent or above for three weeks, progress will stop. For weightlifting, Matveyev had 64 exercises to rotate from. Westside has many more for powerlifting. One must choose six or so to rotate from. Why is it also like the Bulgarian system? No weights are used at 90 to 95 percent, but always attempt a new record on a special barbell exercise, power clean, snatch from below knee, rack pull, low box squat, etc. Work up to a max as fast as possible with as little volume as possible. The total will be the same as speed strength day by the large amount of small special exercises. The ratio for both days is 20 percent barbell and 80 percent small exercises.\nHypertrophy The muscle building comes from the 80 percent small exercises training. A lot of single joint work like arm and back extensions are done in very high volume. Belt squatting and reverse hypers are done for back, hip and hamstrings plus glutes as they act as traction for restoration. I hope you can see by using the Westside system you can improve year in and year out in all facets of training. It is based on mathematics.\nA training day turns into a weekly, monthly, yearly and finally into a multi-year plan. Learn to train, recover using a special exercise, then remove it and go to a new one for greater stimulus. One must find new methods and exercises continuously. By rotating exercises a transition period will take place. This means you should never go backwards, but continuously gain in any special strength including endurance as well as perfecting your sporting technique through practice and special exercises for strength. All the while, your general physical preparedness will increase with this system. One can raise any special strength, even during track season if you reduce some of the needless running. My conclusion? Without a plan you plan to fail.\n-Louie-",

Critics of the reverse hyper claim it’s unhealthy and dangerous for the spine. The only thing dangerous and unhealthy about the reverse hyper is NOT regularly performing it.\nFor one to develop physical capacity, they must be optimally exposed to the hard physical stressors of training. Training loads, specifically external training load, will be the main stressor of focus in regards to the reverse hyper. External training load (i.e. physical work) is critical in understanding the work completed and capabilities/capacities of the individual. Simply, defined as the amount of weight lifted in regards to weight training.\nIt’s vital to understand training with NO progressive increase in external training load will NOT develop increased strength. All the high repetitions non loading back exercises (bird dog crunches, cat camel, etc.) do NOT develop strength. Strength development of the spine or any biological tissue requires a progressive increase in external loading. “…the use of very mild back exercises will do VERY LITTLE to increase the functional strength of the large and powerful muscles of the back. To strengthen the back, one must CHALLENGE the back muscle adequately and gradually INCREASE the TRAINING LOAD which work the back through its FULL FUNCTIONAL RANGE, otherwise THE BACK WILL REMAIN AS WEAK AS IT WAS and recurrence of back problems is inevitable.” – Mel Siff PhD, MSc High repetitions training with NO progressive increase in external loading will develop muscular endurance, some hypertrophy, but NOT strength. Strengthening the spine requires exposing the tissues to progressive external loading training stressors in an optimal setting. There is NO better exercise that allows an individual to progressively overload using external load to strengthen the spine than the reverse hyper\nBy John Quint If you found this post to be informative, please share and subscribe to my blog to receive posts directly to your inbox.

I started my journey into powerlifting in 1966. There was a power meet in nearby Dayton, Ohio, in late October, the month before I was being drafted into the Army, so I entered and found my calling. There were 11 men in my 165-pound weight class.\nI got 10th place, only beating a 55-year-old. I knew this was my sport, and as it turned out, my life. I squatted 410 at 14-years-old, and in 1967 at 19 it was still 410. While in the army in Berlin, Germany, I picked up a copy of Muscle Power Builder, a magazine used by Joe Weider which included weightlifting, bodybuilding and powerlifting articles.\nThey were by a world famous gym called Westside Barbell of Culver City, California. The main information came from Bill West and George Frenn, who was a world record holder in the 56-pound weight throw. And Joe DiMarco who still lives today. I wanted to be the best I could after my first meet with Milt McKinney, George Crawford along with Vince Anello and the great lifter Larry Pacifico, all of whom were from Ohio. I talked to George about my squat. He told me that I must start the lift correctly to do it correctly, and he was right on.\nVince Anello would become one of the greatest deadlifters of all time. He made 821 at 198 pounds. He always had his mom and dad at the meet. I asked Vince what made his deadlift go up?\nHe said to me, “Everything makes my deadlift go up.” I thought what kind of answer is that? But now I know Vince was talking about the conjugate system long before the Russians put a name on it.\nLarry helped me a lot when he told me a person’s triceps are 75 percent of your bench. I also credit Bill Seno of Chicago for showing me the ultra wide grip six, eight and 10 rep system. My main problem was that I had no training partners, just a power rack, a radio, a mirror and my training aids. But now after reading the Muscle Power Builder and the Westside articles, I had imaginary training partners.\nTheir names were West, Frenn, DiMarco, Casey, Merjruian along with Bill Thurber and Tom Overholtzer, a great squatter. They were the greatest on earth. There were also all kinds of athletes, mostly in the field events, such as Frenn, Long, Davis and Connolly who were some of the legends of bodybuilding.\nIn addition, I read about people like Arnold Schwarznegger, Dave Draper and pro wrestlers like Killer Kowalski and super star Billy Graham aka Wayne Coleman. But, my squat was still at 410 pounds.",

First it was called power rack box squats. After Bill had gotten hurt walking out 900 pounds and found himself in the hospital, he came up with the wide rack front to back idea. Back then, most racks were only 12-inch inside to inside. The back for safety with the pins he could train alone without a spotter. He would use two box heights—18-inch and 12-inch.\nHe would sit on the box in a somewhat bent over position. He would lift the bar off the pin after fully sitting on the box by rolling back to relax and contracting the glutes and hips and then standing up. Next came the assistant box squat:\nAn assistant would help with the largest weight by getting in position and “bear hugging” the lifter to help him stand up for the first rep. Then, all of the other reps were unassisted. At 180 bodyweight the author walked out 800 and did a box squat on a 17-inch box, then lowered the bar to the safety pins. After box squatting for 12 weeks, I made a 450-pound squat and in six months I did my first 500-pound squat. In 1978, after getting a 565-pound squat at 172 bodyweight , a 630-pound squat was done in a meet as well as pushing a deadlift up from 525 pounds to 630 pounds to cap off a 1655 total at 180 bodyweight. I had finally moved past that 410-pound squat. Those were the days of no gear at all with a weightlifting belt and a two-hour weigh-in. Back then the author used four boxes in one workout. Working up to a single on first a 17-inch then a 15–inch box along with two sets of 10 reps on a 10-inch box.\nWe would add weight each week working up to a meet using the gradual overload system. West and Frenn were far ahead of their time in not only the squat training, but also in the deadlift. Bill Starr, a very good weight and powerlifter wrote an article entitled something like “Raising your deadlift without deadlifting.” It was right out of the Culver City, Westside system.\nHigh pulls, snatch and clean grips were used. Goodmornings, back extensions were executed by Joe DiMarco. Standing on a two-inch or four-inch box were some of the special exercises used along with calf work, side bends and lots of lat work.",

Like the Russians, they placed boxes under the plate so the bar was just below the knee.\nThis is where the lower back is really stressed. They would work up to the largest weight possible on that day for a single. Straps were used to make it possible to use the most weight you can do to build the greatest amount of back strength.\nWhile the Culver City guys were gone in the early 70s, the Columbus Westside considers this one of the most valuable exercises to test our back strength for the deadlift. Today, we use three levels: just below the knee, two-inch lower, and another two-inch lower where the plates are about four and one-half inches off the floor.\nToday’s Westside also puts rubber mats under the plates. This method works the back by taking the leg drive out of the lift. One example is Jake Norman, a 900-pound deadlifter officially, but with the plates four inches off the floor his best was 810 pounds. Why? Reduced leg drive.\nBill West did a lot of deadlifts with a snatch grip working up to a max three reps. The author made 670 at 180 by standing on a four-inch box and starting the first weights with an ultra-wide grip with a wider foot stance.\nAs the weights go up I would bring my grip in a little and also my foot stance until the largest weights were with a normal close grip and feet close together. The author’s best was 600 pounds on a four-inch box, which made it possible to pull the 670 in a meet at 180 bodyweight.\nThe box squat is the most important exercise the Columbus Westside uses. Casey was the first 800-pound squatter in the history of powerlifting. Frenn made 854 in 1970, no gear at 242. I knew box squats worked then and today. In Columbus we had six members hold squat records.\nAt times the lightest to squat 1000 pounds and 900 pounds and the all-time top coefficient by two men, Chuck Vogelpohl and Dave Hoff, who also holds the highest coefficient of all-time. No matter what your sport, box squats are the most important lower body exercise.\nOne can squat lower and wider on a box. They teach the athlete to start the lift with the correct muscle groups; the hips, glutes and the hamstrings. All squats are to the same depth. This is something that does not happen when doing regular squats. Most of the time, as the weights get larger, the squats get higher, even in contests.",

(While the old Westside mostly used one position, the new Westside uses three to break records on.) They did not stop there. They used a touch system much like the bodybuilders used.\nA bodybuilder would get assistance by having a training partner place their hands on the barbell for squats, bench or curls. Bill West asked why not use it on the deadlift? First, he would use his hands on the bar to give some help while doing a squat clean. West would then slap the glutes to signal the concentric phase. It worked to a degree for the deadlift, but he found a much better way. For most the sticking point for the lower back is at the knees. This is where the bar is farthest from the joint.\nWest found a lifter could deadlift more by placing a hand on the sternum and pulling back to keep the chest up while placing the other hand on the sacrum and pushing forward to keep the correct posture. When doing a high partial deadlift he would place both hands on the traps and pull backward somewhat to help extend the deadlift to completion.\nNow days the Columbus Westside uses chair deadlifts to track perfect position. First, one will sit on a chair or box; most use a sumo style, but a conventional style can be used as well. Start by sitting on a chair with a wide stance and heels at a forward angle. Next, pull the bar toward the body. This will force the knees apart as the bar is lifted while sitting on the chair.\nThen, sit back as far as possible while arching the back and pushing the pelvis toward the bar. Pause for a count of two; then, stand up. If done correctly, the glutes will come toward the bar for the greatest possible leverage. We all know when the butt flies up to the rear you miss the lift. The author looked at the touch system and applied it to the chair system with great success.\nThat covers two lifts, but what about the bench? Pat Casey was the first 600-pound bencher. Of course, Culver City Westside used power rack benches and inclines, very heavy dips and dumbbell presses up to 220 pounds—always some partials and full range work was done.\nHe used seated presses and raises, front, side and rear. Shrugs played a large role as well as hand-stand pushups. This was much like his predecessor from the east coast, Jim Williams. In 1967 Pat made a 617-pound bench and Jim ran that up to 675 at Worlds in 1971. Jim was the largest muscular man I ever saw in 1971 at the Junior National in Patterson, New Jersey.\nHis program was very heavy bodybuilding for a large part of his training. Front raises with a 100-pound plate become known as Williams’ raises and also Williams’ extensions with the elbows out to the sides. After the author had his arm bared severely and could not hold a bar at lockout, I started doing the elbows out extensions and Dave Tate, a Westsider, wrote about them.\nThey became Tate presses after that. However, big Jim made them famous in the 1970s. Jim worked bench five times a week on a system that used only 21 reps starting at 315 and going over 600 pounds each workout. He was able to do this from the high volume of heavy bodybuilding exercises. Lots of heavy raises including triceps and biceps work. Jim Williams was one of the greatest.",

They relied on board presses, rubber pads on the chest and rack work. They used the rubber pads to do what they called belly tosses with very high weights up to 660 pounds by Joe DiMarco. This was just the opposite of the rack work off pins.\nThe rack work was how Casey and the Culver City guys made record benches not only flat benching, but incline and seated as well. Chuck Sipes, a powerful bodybuilder, used the power rack to bench 570 at 220 bodyweight. He did a lot of power rack work off of pins.\nOne method that Chuck liked and credited was long holds on pins, five to 20 seconds for four sets with as heavy of a weight as he could hold off a high pin for his support work. Where his best hold was five seconds, he would stay at the same weight until he could hold it for 20 seconds then increase weight. The press in a full range lift was in a straight line. This was Bill Thrubber’s way at Culver City and Jim Williams as well.\nFloor pressing was used at the Culver City Westside just like today. Some things never grow old as you know. You may also know that the Columbus Westside uses everything the Culver City guys did years ago. It was the Mecca of strength and power then, just like the Columbus Westside is today.\nI not only hold the Culver City Westside Barbell in high esteem, but vowed to carry on where they left off until the day I die. It was my dream to visit all the guys in Culver City, but I could not get off work. Even to this day I have not had a vacation. We have never turned down anyone who wants to visit and train at no cost.\nI know what it means to have the opportunity for training partners and I feel humbled by all who come to Westside, some for months at a time. Without the articles by West, Frenn and Joe DiMarco there would not be Westside Barbell or the Louie you know. I will always be indebted to them.\nI appreciate how much Dave Yarnell revealed in his book Forgotten Secrets of The Culver City Westside Barbell Club. This book has been so important to me as well as all the articles sent to me by my long time friend Dr. Ken Listner. Much of the information in this article came from Dr. Ken’s articles and this great book by Dave Yarnell. I suggest you purchase a copy for your library.=",

If the external training load is below optimal (minimal), positive adaptations of increased STRENGTH will NOT occur due to under training. If the external training load is above optimal (maximal), it can result in decreased physical fitness and at worse induce injury due to over training.\nPart I detailed how strength acquisition of the spine requires a progressive increase in external training load. The aim of Part II is to enable you to understand what an optimal external training load is for you in regards to the reverse hyper. Strength acquisition requires an understanding of how to optimally apply/manage external loads. “The ideal training stimulus ‘sweet spot’ is the one that maximizes net performance potential by having an appropriate training load while limiting the negative consequences of training (ie, injury, illness, fatigue and overtraining).” – Tim Gabbett PhD Tim Gabbett’s approach to optimizing external training load to improve performance and avoid injury is the ratio of “acute: chronic load ration”. This ratio describes the acute training load (most recent week’s training load) to the chronic training load (preceding four-week rolling average of acute training load). He recommends referencing the change or increase of training load relative to the preceding four-week average, NOT just the preceding week alone.\nFor example, if the average amount of weight lifted on the reverse hyper over the previous four weeks was 8,000lbs per week and the current week was going to be 9,000lbs — dividing the chronic work load 8,000 by the current week (acute) of 9,000lbs the ratio is: 1.13. According to the work of Gabbett (pictured below), the ideal ratio, “sweet spot” is 0.8 – 1.3. Gabbett’s work enables us a way to numerically define minimal training, maximal training, and optimal training in regards to external loading: > Minimal is below 0.8\n> Maximal is above 1.5\n> Optimal is 0.8 – 1.3 Review: > Optimal loading will induce positive adaptations of increased fitness that will function to protect against injury.\n> Maximal loading increases risk of injury and/or decreased physical fitness/performance.\n> Minimal loading results in under training.***Under-trained individuals are also at a high risk for injury and/or decreased physical fitness/performance.

Most write it off as only working for geared lifters, and instead turn to other types of programming that emphasize volume and simplicity in exercise selection.\nThere are countless ways to write a program that will yield results, but the name of the game is efficiency. This is where a properly programmed and executed Westside style plan surpasses the standard raw programming, efficiency. The main idea behind the Westside Method is identifying and attacking weakness.\nOnce the weakness is identified, main and accessory exercises are selected to strengthen the lagging muscle group. This is generally where people make mistakes when trying to run a Westside program; they can't properly identify their weaknesses and make poor exercise selections because of it.\nUnderstanding the Basics What I intend to do is provide you with a basic explanation, and examples of how I put my main exercises together for raw training using Westside principles. My goal is to explain it simply, that way you can immediately apply it to your training. Once you begin to see the results from the program, I encourage you to buy the Westside Book of Methods to understand the what and the why.\nThe way I program Westside for my raw training is pretty similar to the standard template, however there are some adjustments I have made over the last few years that have allowed me to make great strength gains. I train max effort lower on Monday, max effort upper on Wednesday, repeated/dynamic effort lower on Friday, and dynamic upper on Saturday.\nThis schedule ensures your rest periods between training days are in line with the recovery times Lou suggests. Basically the only change made from the typical Westside plan is the use of the repeated effort method in place of the dynamic effort method on Friday. However, in the past I have ran a completely conventional Westside style program and had great results only using the dynamic effort method on squat day.\nMax Effort Lower\nThe way I use my max effort lower days is to focus on training the deadlift and the good morning. Three weeks out of the month I will select a deadlift exercise, and then the fourth week will typically be a good morning variation. I wave my percentages for deadlifts week to week, 90-85-90. The fourth week I perform a good morning exercise between 80-85%.\nThe days where I use 90% I keep the reps between 1-2,working up to a top set. If I am training to 85% of my max, I work up to a triple. In my experience this approach provides adequate rest week to week, and won't leave you broken or in need of a deload. The table below shows a month's worth of exercises, along with the proper rep schemes and percentages: Week 1 2 3 4 Exercise Deficit Deadlifts Conventional Deadlifts Block/Mat Deadlifts Giant Camber Goodmornings Reps 1-2 3 1-2 3-5 Percentage 90+ 85 90+ 80-85 Max Effort Upper\nTo train my bench, I employ the max effort method primarily, however I do use the repeated effort method once a month to give my shoulders and elbows a break while also achieving some upper body hypertrophy. This is a trick I learned training at Westside on Sunday mornings with one of the greatest benchers of all time, George Halbert.\nI typically throw the repeated effort method day in after my heaviest press week of the month. For instance if I were to take a max effort press against average bands in week two, week three would be a repeated effort method day to give my upper body a break. This is a minor tweak that makes a huge difference recovery wise. The table below shows a month's worth of exercises, and proper percentages: Week 1 2 3 4 Exercise Close Grip Bench (paused) Flat Bench + Average Bands (paused) Competition Style Bench (paused) Flat Bench + Chains (paused) Reps 1-2 1 3-5 1 Percentage 90+ 90+ 80-85 90+ Repeated Effort/Dynamic Effort Lower\nThis is where I make the biggest change to the standard template, by using a mix of the repeated effort and dynamic effort methods. Each month I dedicate two weeks to squatting weight without bands or chains, and the other two I employ the dynamic effort method using accommodating resistance.\nI squat to a box 3 times a month typically. I prefer box squats for two reasons; I believe they yield better strength and speed gains versus conventional squatting, and the box relieves stress in my knees.\nI find that I always feel very fresh when I take the box away and free squat, and there is no loss in strength because of the box. People who say box squatting doesn't translate well to raw, or will affect your ability to hit proper depth simply do not understand what they are talking about.\nThe only way you will have depth issues from box squatting is if you set your box height too high. You always want to squat to a slightly below parallel box, or lower depending on the selected exercises.\nOn repeated effort method day I work up to a top set, on dynamic effort day I warm up to a working weight, then execute 10-12 working sets. I prefer to use 75% bar weight for my dynamic squat days. The table below shows a month's worth of exercises, and proper percentages: Week 1 2 3 4 Exercise Competition Squat to a low box (no mats) Speed Squats to normal box (average bands) Front Squats Speed Squats to normal box (heavy chains) Reps 3 2 for 10-12 sets 3 2 for 10-12 sets Percentage 85-90 75 85-90 75 Dynamic Effort Upper\nThe Westside approach to bench pressing is, in my opinion, the most superior way and it's because of the emphasis Lou puts on speed bench press. I program my speed bench days exactly as Lou prescribes in the Westside Book of Methods.\nIn my experience, if you are properly executing speed bench your bench will climb drastically. If you are not using the dynamic effort method to train your bench press you are cheating yourself.\nTo ensure you are executing proper speed, use 3 seconds as the maximum amount of time it should take to complete a set. I always shoot to beat 3 seconds, but if you cannot complete a set in under 3 seconds you need to immediately drop the bar weight. Otherwise, you will be doing pointless presses against light bands.\nI also like to use my dynamic effort upper days to train my overhead press immediately following my speed bench. I have noticed my presses are always stronger after doing so. The table below shows a month's worth of exercises, and proper percentages. Week 1 2 3 4 Workout Speed Bench + Mini Bands Speed Bench + Mini Bands Speed Bench + Mini Bands Speed Bench + Chains Reps 3 for 10-12 sets 3 for 8-10 sets 3 for 8-10 sets 3 for 10-12 sets Percentage 50 55 60 50 The Bigger Picture\nWhat I have provided above is a very basic, simplistic approach to the Westside method that you can implement into your training immediately. You could run the programming I provided above for as long as you wanted, making basic tweaks in exercise selection and percentage adjustments, and make great gains in strength.\nNowadays, online strength coaching personalities like to make training into rocket science, but when you break it all down it is fucking simple. Getting stronger is a lot easier than you think. The advantage of a Westside style program is the level of customization, and personalization it offers.\nBy constantly identifying and attacking weakness, you are ensuring you are producing the strongest lifter you can using the most efficient means. Your success is 100% dependant on your ability to identify your weakness, and make proper exercise selections.\nThe biggest variable in the program is the human being using it. As a lifter it is paramount that you begin to learn your body and the basic principles of strength for yourself. Do not depend on an online coach, or anybody else to constantly give you guidance or feedback.\nTake responsibility and read the books the online coaches read, attend the seminars they attend. Learn this stuff for yourself, form your own training group, help bring up the group training IQ, and you will find yourself making constant gains in the gym.\nThe secret to Westside isn't a trick in the program, it is the fact that when you are at Westside Barbell you are training directly under Louie Simmons, along with a host of other knowledgeable people who are constantly watching and identifying your weaknesses.\nConsidering not everyone will have the opportunity to train under Lou, it is important you have your own knowledgeable crew of lifters willing to help contribute. Teach yourself, teach your group, and you will be surprised at how fast you can get strong.\nAll of the strongest people I know in the world all have one thing in common; they know their body and they know how to train themselves. Take the time to learn, and you will be strong for a lifetime.\nThe game is to be told not sold, so if some asshole is trying to get you to paypal some cash for advice, spend the money on a book instead. When it comes to strength training there is more than one way to skin a cat, but as Lou says, Westside Rules.",

The philosophy tends to be that the main exercise is where you put up or shut up, and then come accessory time it ends up being a race to get home and relax.\nThen, in eight weeks time when you've barely made progress, you log onto your favorite forum and trash whichever method seemed to have failed you. What if it isn't the program failing you, but your own approach to the program? Your main exercise of the training day isn't where you improve, it is where you prove. You prove that you're making proper progress by hitting a PR, or you prove that you need to correct your weaknesses. The success of any program depends on two things; your ability to find your weaknesses, and your ability to properly select accessory movements to correct the weakness. Hopefully by the end of this article you will either have an affirmation that you're training correctly, or an epiphany that you are fucking over yourself. Below you will find suggested accessories for each training day, along with a brief explanation regarding the approach.\nMax Effort Lower Accessories\nOn max effort lower day, I tend to choose accessories that primarily train the hamstrings/glutes, lower/mid back, and quads. I choose two hamstring/glute exercises, a lower/mid back exercise, and a quad exercise.\nOn this day accessory volume is a bit less than normal, but the intensity makes up for it. You want to make sure your effort matches the suggested rep range, don't be a 700lb deadlifter and use 225lbs for RDL's. The table below provides suggested accessory movements, as well as set and rep guidelines. Exercise Sets Reps Romanian Deadlift 3-5 5-8 Good Mornings 5 3-5 Bent Over Rows 3-5 5-8 Leg Press 3-5 10-15 Abs 3-5 15-20 Max Effort Upper Accessories\nOn max effort upper day, the primary focus is on two muscle groups; your arms and your back. You won't find many great bench pressers who have small arms and narrow backs.\nTaking this into consideration, I typically choose two tricep exercises, two back exercises, one bicep exercise, and one shoulder exercise. As stated above, if the reps are low the weight should be heavier. The table below provides suggested accessory movements, as well as set and rep guidelines. Exercise Sets Reps Dumbbell Tricep Extensions 3-5 10-12 Tate Presses 3-5 10-12 Bent Over Rows 3-5 8-10 Pullups/ Or Cable Pulldowns 3 10-12 Hammer Curls 5 8-10 Dumbbell Lateral Raises 3-5 12-15 Dynamic Effort or Repetition Lower Accessories\nOn dynamic effort/repetition lower day I select accessories that are different from the movements I used on my max effort lower day. I use both my dynamic lower and upper days to focus on exercises I wasn't able to do during my max effort training days. I also like to throw in an extra squat exercise as an accessory, but I keep the reps higher and the weight at or below 70%. I use this extra squat exercise as a way to work mobility as well.\nThe emphasis is more on depth and bar speed opposed to heavy weight. This breaks down to an extra squat workout, two glute/hamstring movements, a back movement, and a quad movement. The table below provides suggested accessory movements, as well as set and rep guidelines. Exercise Sets Reps Paused Front Squats 3-5 5-8 Deficit Stiff Legged Deadlifts 3-5 5-8 Dimel Deadlifts 3 8-10 Power Cleans 3 3-5 Hack Squats 3 8-10 Abs 5 15-20 Dynamic Effort Upper Accessories\nAs stated in the dynamic lower accessories above, the dynamic effort day accessory selection is used to catch yourself up with whatever exercises you weren't able to hit on your max effort upper day.\nThe approach is still the same in regards to focusing on arm and back development, but I also like to throw in an overhead press exercise immediately following my speed bench workout. I do this for two reasons; I tend to have fresh shoulders after speed bench, and I get a carryover in bar speed from being fresh off a speed bench workout.\nWhenever I would do overhead presses following a ME upper exercise I would end up grinding out weights and going home with achy shoulders. Also, I prefer to use overhead presses opposed to incline bench presses. Incline benching with a bar puts my shoulders in a much more compromised position than overhead pressing does. If I do any incline benching, it is always done with dumbbells. I typically do two tricep exercises, two back exercises, one bicep exercise, and one shoulder exercise. The table below provides suggested accessory movements, as well as set and rep guidelines. Exercise Sets Reps Standing Overhead Press 5 3-5 V-Bar Tricep Cable Presses 3 10-12 Tate Presses 3-5 8-10 Bent Over Rows 3-5 5-8 Pullups/ or Pulldowns 3 10-12 DB Bicep Curl 5 10-12 DB Lateral Raises 3 10-12 Final Thoughts\nPeople in the strength community like to discount the Westside Method due to a lack of volume, when that couldn't be further from the truth. When I trained at Westside one of the biggest ideas Lou drilled into my head was to identify my weaknesses and train my accessories like a son of a bitch to bring my weaknesses up quickly. Guess what this entails? Volume. When I train a main lift I want to train it with maximum speed and effort, the same way I would approach a lift on the platform.\nI'll get my volume and hypertrophy work achieved in the accessories. I may be stupid, but for the life of me I cannot understand the craze of squatting, deadlifting, or benching for sets of 5 and 8 as a main exercise. In my opinion, 1-3 reps is the desired rep range for a main workout, sets of 5 and 8 set the intensity level too low.\nIf I do a set of 5 I am either taking it light that week or I went for an AMRAP set, which I do sometimes for fun. The goal of your main lifts should be to train for strength and power, or bar speed. Save the hypertrophy and volume for your accessories. There are tried and true methods and then there are trends, choose wisely.\nBurley Hawk",

As with any therapy, with regular use its benefits are enhanced. Stress, tension and pain have formed over time and will take some time to experience the greatest relief—luckily, floating is a relaxing, fun,and effortless way to do so!\nFloat therapy offers relief and benefits which are cumulative—they build on themselves with each subsequent session. We like to say “the more you float, the better it gets”, as floats themselves deepen beyond the first session. Though flotation is an “effortless” therapy, the body and mind actually learn how to relax into the float with each session.\nFor these reasons, we encourage guests to return to floating more than once, and to receive sessions on a regular basis to maintain their benefits. FLOATING IS REST (RESTRICTED ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULUS THERAPY) THINK OF IT AS A RESET BUTTON WITH THREE LEVELS: SALT Epsom Salts are great for your skin, hair, nails, and act as an exfoliate. They aid in joint pain, ease stress, and naturally relax the body. Magnesium (commonly missing from our diets) is absorbed through the skin, while Sulfate eliminates toxins and heavy metals, naturally detoxing the body. WEIGHTLESS 1000 pounds of salt in 180 gallons of water creates a 30% salt solution, enabling the human body to float effortlessly atop the water. This creates an anti-gravity environment. This sensation is unique and deeply relaxing, as all weight and tension can be dropped; it’s even safe to fall asleep. There are no pressure points on the body in this state, which can provide up to 100% pain relief. The spine naturally elongates and straightens, and the body undergoes the same regeneration process that transpires during sleep. Lactic acid is drained from the muscles, reducing soreness and recovery time. MEDITATION Finally, just taking an hour of alone time (meditation), will decrease the production of cortisone, a stress hormone, leaving us feeling refreshed and serene after the float. The brain enters an elusive theta brain-wave state, associated with deep sleep and dreaming. We are able to access deeper levels of creativity and higher-level problem solving due to this distraction-free environment. The water is even heated to skin temperature, nearly eliminating any sensations at all; it feels like floating on a cloud, or in outer space. All of the benefits of an hour meditation are inherently seen in flotation therapy. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

The use of low temperatures to relieve pain and inflammation2. An alternative to cold water immersion that involves exposing individuals to extremely cold dry air (below -100°C) for several minutes FIRST TIME DOING CRYO?\nNo Problem! We welcome everyone to watch our introductory video on cryotherapy, which will explain what to expect and some important safety procedures to follow during your treatment. WHAT IS WHOLE BODY CRYOTHERAPY? Cryotherapy is a practice that uses a ‘cryosauna’, a machine that dispenses nitrogen gas around the body & aims to cool the surface temperature of the body to sub freezing temperatures to activate a beneficial physiological response. A Cryotherapy session typically lasts 3 minutes and can reach temperatures near -200ºF. WHERE DID CRYOTHERAPY COME FROM? Whole Body Cryotherapy found its beginnings in Japan in the late 1970’s by Dr. Yamaguchi, who first started using freezing treatments on his arthritis patients for pain management. What Dr. Yamaguchi found was that his patients experienced a significant reduction in soreness and joint pain after the drastic temperature decrease of the outer layers of skin.These patients experienced a huge release of endorphins as a result of the cold treatment, leading to a reduced sensitivity to pain and decreased inflammation. Throughout the 1980s, Dr. Yamaguchi and his team found that exposure to rapid, short-term freezing temperatures produce a non-invasive approach to effectively managing pain. HOW DO I DO CRYOTHERAPY? At Ohio Cryo, we use a cryosauna chamber built in The United States by Impact Cryotherapy. When it’s time for treatment, a client will strip down to the undergarments and then put on warm mittens & slippers to protect the most vulnerable extremities from the threat of frostbite, as well as a robe.\nWhen the client steps into the cryosauna for their treatment, the door will shut and the hood will be closed atop of the chamber exposing just the client’s head. That’s when the three-minute treatment begins and the ultra-cooled nitrogen gas is released, triggering thermoreceptors in the dermis which sends electrical impulses to the brain and central nervous system, sending the body into “Survival Mode”. This process sends hyper-oxygenated and nutritious blood to the body’s vital organs in its core.\nWhen the three minutes are up, the client steps out of the chamber and the body immediately begins to warm up to its natural temperature. Vasodilation begins, sending the oxygenated and nutritious blood back out to the body’s periphery. This process provides the body with extra nutrients, rids the body of toxins, produces collagen and activates the body’s natural cell regeneration cycle to produce newer, healthier cells. The end results: a reduction in discomfort & pain in areas of inflammation. WHAT IS CRYOTHERAPY GOOD FOR? Whole Body Cryotherapy was originally used to manage pain associated with arthritis, however it can be used to treat almost any form of chronic pain. Recently, elite athletes looking for faster recovery from strenuous training have found it to benefit their rigorous lifestyle. At Ohio Cryo, we have found that adults of any age will experience positive benefits regardless of their lifestyle or energy level. A good candidate for Cryotherapy is really anyone who could benefit from increased energy and alertness, reduced inflammation, reduced pain, improved sleep, or anyone looking to restore their body & mind by tapping into the body’s natural rejuvenation processes. WHY SHOULD I USE CRYOTHERAPY? Since the main goal of Whole Body Cryotherapy is to trigger natural, physiological reactions stimulated by low temperatures, Cryotherapy is right for you if you are interested in a body that is capable of reducing pain naturally and can repair its muscles after heavy exertion and you value a sharp mind that can think clearer through increased nervous system function.\nThe effects of Cryotherapy are independent of the age of the patients. Cryotherapy is linked to an improvement in mood and in some patients has even led to an increase in self-control, which is vital when undertaking any type of regimented therapy or workout program. Across the country, leading spa and wellness centers are beginning to offer Cryotherapy treatments as a new method of wellness, anti-aging and stress mitigation.\nThe body is an amazing tool. Activate your greatness with Cryotherapy and start living better, recovering faster with less inflammation & pain. HOW OFTEN SHOULD I DO WHOLE BODY CRYOTHERAPY? 1 TREATMENT A single session of Cryotherapy is enough for instant relief from inflammation and soreness and is good for an energy boost that will last you the rest of the day. Three minutes of treatment and you are on your way to pain relief and a productive day. 3-5 TREATMENTS With three to five sessions of Whole Body Cryotherapy, you will begin to repair damaged body areas as joint pain is alleviated, your total energy level increases and fresh, nutrient-enriched blood continuously floods damaged body areas. 7 TREATMENTS Seven back-to-back treatments will serve as an entire system restart. This is where the body moves from the repair stage to the complete rehabilitation stage. Seven sessions can jumpstart weight-loss, speed up post-surgical recovery and especially benefit postpartum mothers. The ultimate system cleanse. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Nowadays there’s a tool for anything and everything, and most of them are tremendous for repairing the aches and pains of strength training, WE LOVE EX-WIVES, but before your reach for one of the many tools on the market to fix those elbows take a second a reach for the right barbell. All too often folks are squatting with a weightlifting bar (no center knurling) if this is of necessity, due to no other option in your gym, or garage seriously think of adding a power bar to your life, but we can’t control everything in every gym around the world, if you have the option of a power bar USE IT! The smooth center of a weightlifting bar, provides zero grip on the back which means that bar is free to roll down throughout your set, straining the connective tissue and tendons in the elbow- THIS could be the cause of your elbow pain, if it exists, more so than anything being performed with the upper body. Yes, if you are underneath a power bar, your bar placement could be too low… However this quick note was not written to discuss squat style, only to bring up an issue that some may not be aware of… There is always someone somewhere beginning their journey into strength, we care just as much about these folks as we do world records and pitbulls. And on the subject of bars… For squats up to 500 lbs, you are probably fine with a Texas Power Bar- Depending on shoulder mobility and size. For squats in the 500 - 700 lbs range we recommend the Texas Squat Bar. Annnnnd for anything over 700 lbs you may be best suited to place yourself underneath a Bull Dog Squat Bar, this guy is designed to handle loads in excess of 1200 pounds. Those last few lines were a bit off subject, but I am asked these questions upwards of 50 times per week… There ya go! -Gus.",

There are many factors that determine this, and Issurin focalizes these points in Athletic Talent.\nIt seems that heredity can lead to one being, as they say, “gifted” toward a particular sport or activity. Some children show great promise as early as 3 to 5 years of age, while other children must be exposed to guidance or education and will show giftedness later - from 7 to 10 years old. Still others are a year or two behind until early adulthood and only then will they surpass their competition. Out of this entire population, there are very few truly gifted children, about 1%.\nAlong with genealogy, body types and genetics always play a role in achieving sports excellence. A 6’5” male weighing over 300 pounds would make an excellent lineman, and yet a terrible receiver - even though his height at a lighter body weight would suggest differently. Along the same vein, it would not be possible to play professional basketball while standing at 5’ tall. While one may shine as a wrestler at this stature - the athlete must choose the sport in which their natural build will bring them the most success. We all have seen it, one can have a million dollar body and a 10 cent brain. Beyond inherited ability, a child’s geographical roots can play a significant role in their sporting success. Latin American children play baseball, while Brazil has thousands of soccer players for the younger generations to look up to and emulate. Sports that have produced athletes for children to look up to in America are football, basketball, track and field, as well as women’s gymnastics. This is due to a large base of juniors to pick from, and the 1% of these juniors will rise to the top. Sports that are on TV have a huge following that entice youth to participate in these sports, meaning that social media plays a large role in our sports development. For example - everyone, it seems, wants to participate in the Olympic Games. They realize they must be built similar to their Olympic heroes and that they represent a model athlete.\nYesterday’s athletes cannot compete in today’s world of specialization. To increase their chances of success, an athlete must go to a sports schools with qualified coaches that have one goal, high performance preparation. This will help determine if one is a team player, or should participate in a sport with zero teammates: boxing, wrestling, tennis, or bowling for example. From the very beginning, one must enjoy what they are doing. A few questions will separate those with athletic talent from the rest. Are they committed to training? Do they want to be great? Do they have the genetics and psychological profile to succeed? Then, is the athlete trainable? Are they excelling at their endeavor? Can one show continued progress? Years ago, pro baseball scouts would choose young catchers as early as 13 for a pro career, only to find they peaked at 17 or 18 years old while other competitors continued to gain greater motor skills and maturity in their later years. In Athletic Talent, Issurin has made it possible to distinguish all of the above. This fine book covers all manners of how to identify and develop a world class athlete and should be in every coach’s library.",

The gym has its great and historic past with its lifters, innovative training methods and devices. No one knows how the pyramids were built, but thanks to Dave Yarnell - you are about to find out how Louie started his club; the original Westside club from Culver City, California. Bill West, George Frenn, Bill Thurber, and Pat Casey trained for pure strength training.\nBefore Westside California, bodybuilders were basically the only ones on the scene. It was also a haven for throwers like Frenn, Hal Connelly, George Woods and Dallas Long. They wrote articles in a magazine known as Muscle Power Builder. Their article on box squatting caught Louie’s eye first, as his squat was stuck at 410 pounds.\nBut Westside had much more to offer - power rack training for all three lifts, floor press, belly toss, benching with rubber pads on the chest, pulling on boxes, and many more innovations for which Louie will always be indebted to Westside. Beyond innovations in movements, they also had technical innovations, such as the first use of a wide stance squat with the bar set lower on the back - the first power squat.\nBack then, the AAU controlled powerlifting due to their reigning control over weightlifting. It was West and Frenn who pushed for powerlifting to have its own body. Their effort lead Bob Hoffman of York Barbell to host the first world powerlifting championship. The Culver City guys were basically done by then and it was at that point that Louie started unofficially calling his one-man show Westside. This was a tribute to West and the gang, and was fitting as he resided on the western side of Columbus. Joe Dimarco, still kicking in California, had much input on the early training innovations and shared many of these ideas with Louie. Like today’s Westside, the Culver City gym has countless visitors.\nA friend of Louie, Roger Estep, made a trip to visit Bill, Frenn and the rest of the Culver City members. He spent the summer training in California and went back to Ohio University with about 200 pounds added on his total. Remember, there was zero gear and no 24 hour weigh-ins. Roger told me what he did during his visit and I was on track by reading those articles. Roger brought back the information to the wild bunch, including Luke Iams and Chuck Dunbar, and from there they were hard to beat.\nAll the lifters who started in the 1960’s adopted some of their training methods from the early Westside boys. Like Westside today, the Culver City boys shared all of their training methods for anyone to try. Their own Pat Casey had the first 800 pound squat, 600 pound bench and a 2000 pound total.\nThey were light years ahead of their time and Louie took it all in and later, improved on it. It was his duty - for without Bill, Pat, Joe, George, and all the Culver City guys, there would not be a Louie Simmons and today’s Westside Barbell. This immense work by Dave Yarnell is a must-read; know the past and present so you will succeed in the future.",

They helped others as well. A good friend and lifter, Roger, made the trip I could not to Culver City Westside to learn first-hand how to implement their system. After returning to Ohio with about 200 lbs. on his total, I asked Roger what he did while training with West, Frenn, and the gang at Culver City. He told me about the box squats rack work for all three lifts and floor press, benching with the rubber pad on his chest, the high dead lift, and the very high volume. After returning to West Virginia he became a world record holder for the squat and total at 198 pounds. Roger had the body to go along with his great strength. After his return to West Virginia and working with the wild bunch at Luke Iames gym, Chuckie Dunbar became a world champ and many time national champ and world record holder. Not to mention Scott Warman, Jack Wilson and maybe the most charismatic of them all, Rickey Crain, who went on to a long and highly successful lifting career breaking many world records including the first 800 squat at 165. He also made a 716 deadlift at 165. He now runs Crain's Muscle World. I was doing the same things Roger had talked about, so I was on the right track. The strength was there at a high level, but it was by doing the only periodization known at that time in America. It would call for increasing intensity while lowering volume. This was western periodization and it was hit-or-miss at best; mostly a dead-end street. I remember Dave Waddington, the first 1,000 pound squatter from Sandusky, Ohio, was at my house eating chicken when he said “You know Louie, you break a gym record in the weeks before the meet only to fall short on the meet day.” Ricky Crain would call me and say he did big numbers in training only to go backwards on meet day. What’s wrong? I recall telling Rick, “ When you figure that out, call me.” I was having the same problem they were encountering, but no answer. As usual, an injury would cause me to find a better way. I broke my fifth lumbar in 1981 and trained on it until I got smashed like Bill West did. But, this time, I set the safety pins in the power rack to low and when missing a heavy low-box squat, I set back down on the box and bent over to unload the 725 on the pins. When I did, I was trapped on the box with the bar on my back and that is when it broke for good. A doctor wanted to remove two disks and take bone spurs off and fuse my back. I refused and rehabbed it myself. It took 17 weeks and during that time I knew I was missing something in my training, but what? Just like other top- 10 lifters I was not reaching my full potential where it counts-on meet day. I knew the Soviets were way ahead of the rest of the world in sports performance. I saw kaiju’s, meaning strange creatures, yes, real monsters, on the platform in America. No country, including Russia, had such physical specimens. But since their Olympic weight lifters had left our Olympic weight lifters far to the rear, they must know something. There was no power-lifting in Russia, but maybe their approach to training could be the answer I was looking for. I found the name of a man who had translated Russian training into English. His name was Bud Andrew Charniga, Jr. I called him and said I wanted to buy any books he had. He said, “You know, Louie, the books I have are class-room books.” I said, “That is exactly what I need.” I started with Managing the Training of Weightlifters. The book covered all aspects of weight-lifting. I converted it to powerlifting by following the data by A S. Prilepin. I never thought about how many lifts per work out and how many lifts at a certain percentage.\nThis would keep my training optimal for the first time. But where should most of my barbell training be trained? This was covered by more scientists such as A.D. Ermakov and N.S. Atanasov and their research on 780 high-level weight-lifters. By this time it is early 1982 and I did have training partners. However, now I had even more training partners influencing my training just like Frenn, West and the rest of the Westside guys from Muscle Power Builder. This time it was a group of Soviet sport scientists who, unfortunately, I would never meet. I truly believe I owe everything to those Soviet scientists for what Westside has done and will do. I bought every book Bud had to gain further knowledge and now I sell them at Westside. There are too many great men to name all of them, but I was highly influenced by A.S. Medvedyev, R. A. Roman, Laputin, Oleshko, Frolov, Ivanov Vorobyev, and Kusnetsov Bosco.\nBut Verkhoshansky would be a guiding light to my thoughts on training. His work on the stretch-reflex system lead my work on over speed eccentrics. He was the total master in all aspects of sport and combining exercise to athletics. Additionally, another true genius to the Soviet system V.M. Zatsiorsky had the first edition of Science and Practice of Strength Training in 1992. That book showed I was on the right track. Just like the Culver City system, until I talked to Roger Estep I was not sure I was on the right track. So ten years into the new system there was a book that confirmed I was doing things correctly: Placing severe workouts 72 hours apart; training special strengths separately; using a max effort day twice a week, one for the upper and one for the lower body; and having a dynamic day that proved to be very important for all three lifts.\nMany don’t understand it, but the barbell volume on max effort day is very low. On dynamic day it is very high. All training must be extreme, including volume, to avoid accommodation. Also, the bar velocity must change radically as well. This is proven by the force-velocity curve, first shown by Hill's equations. While the Bulgarians would do a max based on a daily record max where the intensity zone would be close to 100 percent, the Westside system for max effort results in a new all-time record on a special barbell exercise over 90 percent of the time for the entire group. This was documented by our statistics man Joe Lasko. For our dynamic or speed strength the barbell weight in a three week pendulum wave is 75 percent to 80 percent and 85 percent or with accommodation resistance, the bar weight is 50 percent to 55 percent and 60 percent with 25 percent band tension at lock out. I used the data from the work of A.D. Ermakov and N.S. Atanasov showing 50 percent of the training of 780 high-skilled weight-lifters was 75 to 85%. By matching this data along with A.S. Prilepin's data on loading it is impossible to under or over train with the barbell. The Soviet training method, the three-week pendulum wave cycle, came from the research by (Ermakov,1994). By now I knew what I had missed in training-it was science. I knew exercises- having talked to great lifters-in all three lifts, but it now was clear when and how to implement them to the program. But there was an aspect to the Soviets training system that kept their lifters well ahead of ours. It was special exercises and special exercise machines. Power rack training, isometrics, belt squats, Good-morning machines, chambered bars, jumping and even an accommodating resistance device, like Culver City Westside and their advanced training methods. (And don’t forget the calf/ham/glute machine!) The Soviets were combining exercise and science to promote sports excellence. The Soviets really applied this term to sports by letting their sports scientists work closely with their top sportsmen. The term “sports science degree “ is just a catchy name to place on a worthless degree in the United States. It has no substance for real-life training. I realized the Soviets were always looking for new training methods or the approach to training. V. Alexeev would do 100 singles with 100 kilograms in the power snatch or do pulls standing in water up to his knees, hips, or even higher. He also did inverse back raises. I thought about their special exercises and remembered after breaking my lower back in 1973 how it was that no one had an answer to my problem. I thought about how a back raise was a great special exercise, but by applying pressure on my heels to raise my upper body it hurt so much I could not begin to do it. But, what if I did it in reverse by supporting my upper body and lifting my legs up to the rear? I did it with no pain after 12 months of pain. And that’s how the reverse hyper was first used in our training. Next, our A.T.P, Athletic Training Platform. I knew Westside must stay out in front of all gyms in athletic performance and training methodologies as well as with special training devices. One of these is the band bar created by one of our long-time members Jimmy Seitzer, who has trained at Westside since 1976. So far 11 United States patents have been granted to Westside. The next one in the next few months will revolutionize the strength world. To raise the stakes at Westside we had to bring a new person, special exercises, or exercise machines like the inverse curl into our training to advance the lifts and totals. Westside started in my basement, then my garage, and on to bigger buildings until our present 3,600 square foot facility. It is private with no sign, but is known around the world. I was influenced by Dr. Squat (aka Fred Hatfield) and his very explosive style of lifting, but more so his scientific approach to lifting. Fred said I needed a calf/ham/glute bench, then an isokinetic power rack. He even suggested an electric stem machine. He was at a much higher level about training then anyone else. In 1979 at the North American championships we both competed and he hands the IPF official a set of knee wraps that were huge compared to what everyone else was using. The official said, “No way Jose. “ Fred had sewed the waist bands of jock straps together making his wraps about three times thicker then any other wrap at that time. After a long argument, Fred won as there was no rule in place that would disallow his new thicker wrap. He then broke the record of the great Ron Collins of Great Britain with a 738 pound lift at 181 pounds. The more I read the more I saw science must be tied to my training. I knew I had to apply physics to further my goals. First it was using submaximal weights with the highest attainable speed (F=ma)-this is the dynamic method. It made it possible to regain bar speed into our training. I was reading Super-training and was fascinated by the term kinetic energy (KE).\nKE is based on its mass and its speed. If you want to increase KE, it is more important to increase velocity rather than its mass. So how could I increase the eccentric phase to increase the reversible speed of the athlete? I decided that by attaching rubber bands to the barbell it would cause greater bar speed on the eccentric phase, which leads to a faster concentric effort resulting in lifting larger weights in training as well as when competing. Unlike in school, Newton's laws became extremely important to me to advance the training at Westside. What is momentum? And what is work, and how can being more powerful help you work faster?\nAfter experimentation by my old friend Dave Williams of Liberty University with rubber bands with great results the concepts of Hooke's Law of Elasticity proved to be of great importance. And, after becoming friends with Dr. Mel Siff of Super training fame it was clear that sports are a combination of physics, biomechanics and mathematics. It made me realize that when you solve a training problem you just create a new problem.\nThis is the theory of advanced training. Dr Siff credited my findings with weight releasers, chains and bands as combinations of resistance methods. It was such an honor to do seminars with Mel, but most of all to have a relationship about training at the highest level as well as a friendship I will never forget. I have been very fortunate to know Dr. Nicholas Romanov PhD, who developed the pose method of running.\nA team doctor of the Bulgarian Olympic Weight lifting Team also came to visit Westside and talked about their training system, so I could fully understand it. Boris Sheiko, the renowned Russian powerlifting coach, paid Westside a visit as well. It was such a pleasure to sit and talk training methods.\nI don't know why our countries can't get along as well as brothers in sports. I remember when this jacked dude came walking into Westside and proclaimed he was the strength coach for the Jamaican track club. And that he was. His name was Jay Spry. He was excited to exchange training methods. He was also fascinated with our specialty equipment for track. The Jamaican team now has them at their disposal. Phil Richards came to Westside and studied our methods, returned to the United Kingdom and had the only team in the premier league to go 26 and 0, as well as several other titles. Many NFL coaches have spent time at Westside...really too many to recall. But two shook hands on the field before the 1996 Superbowl and sent me the picture: Ken Johnson and Johnny Parker of the Packers and Patriots, respectively. There have been so many college coaches at the lowest level visit Westside only to raise up to become athletic directors or top college and pro level coaches. I like to think that those visits to Westside had something to do with it. Westside has worked with UFC heavyweight champs to Olympic gold medal champions and every sport in between. I could never visit Culver City Westside, and it would have meant so much to me. This is why all are invited to come to Westside to visit or train. We have never said no to anyone, man or woman. Some of the strongest men and women come from all over the world to train not only powerlifters, but all sports. And we have our education certificates for all sports training set up by Tom Barry.\nTom, who is from Ireland, came like many to do an internship over six years ago and he now runs the business side of Westside. Outside of the business Tom has become one of my most accomplished students and he coaches our pro fighters, football players and multiple other top level athletes at Westside. The lifters are accustomed to having visitors ask all sorts of questions after training. Westside has many lifetime friends from every corner of the world from China to South Africa and all points in between. Everyone thanks us, but it is Westside that thanks them for the honor to host them. A gym is just four walls without the men and women inside those walls. Westside is a club. Since its start it has been very a close group- always going out at night and eating breakfast together. Like any family we hate and love each other at the same time. The greatest asset a lifter can have is good training partners. Westside is not open to the public due to its highest caliber of lifters. Anyone can visit, but only a very few can train at Westside. But it should be everyone's goal to train hard and someday join the club. Danny Dipascuia, the strength coach of the Melbourne Storm, comes to Westside each year to see what's new that can help his team. He always trains while he's at Westside. Not only is Danny a great coach, but also an accomplished lifter. One time he went to the Nite of the Living Deadlift event. It is a deadlift-only meet in Johnson City, Tennessee, home of the legendary deadlifter, Bob Peoples. All my friends and memories come from Westside, as Westside is my life. Like I said, lifters make a gym. I never had a training partner from 1970 to 1973. Bill Whittaker was my first training partner in 1973. He won his first national championship in 1980 and later became a doctor of veterinarian medicine. Then there was Doug Heath who would win many championships. An early training partner, Jim Seitzer, became Mr. USA and third and fifth in the Mr. America. He is still a regular at Westside who invented the Band Bar. I must say Doug and Jimmy are just as crazy as they were in the 70s. Then Gary Sanger came to Ohio State to teach. Now Gary leads the department of economics at L.S.U., he was also the number one on the 1984 top 10. Another brainy guy, Dr. Tom Paulucci, was an attorney and doctor of psychology. All of these men are lifetime friends. Tom passed away a few years ago and now his son Ethan trains at Westside just like his dad did. This group trained in my garage; most were PhD's. Then Matt Dimel came to train with Gary Sanger. This was our odd couple. A college professor and a maniac. But he was our maniac, holding the world record SHW squat for several years. A short story: one Sunday I benched 500 at 198 and Matt did 505 at SHW. That Friday after squatting we were sitting in my living room- me in my underwear- when Matt reminded me he had out-benched me. I said, “F you fat ass. I benched 515 before and that beats your 505.” He said, “I will bet you a case of beer I can bench 515 cold right now.” I said ok, and he grabbed me by my shirt and threw me through my backyard in my underwear into the gym and loaded 515 on the bar with no warm-ups and benched it. I got the case of beer, but I put on pants first. He was mental. Matt passed on in 1994 at 34, way too young. He was like the son I never had and sorely missed. He was bigger than life. He put Bob Coe through hell, but it was like heaven to us. Matt had a tattoo on his arm that said “G.F.H.” That was my advice to him the first time I saw him. He's at rest now, but there is no peace for anyone up there with him. It's hard to see guys like Matt and John Flor go so young, but they lived life to the fullest. Gary Benford also trained in the garage and at the Downtown YMCA. He also ran some of the best power meets ever: The Senior Nationals and the YMCA Nationals, along with the WPC Worlds. I don't want to forget about the early Westside women. Lara Dodd, for example, a former track star at Ohio State turned power lifter extraordinaire, breaking the world record in the squat at 165 plus a 534 dead lift. Also a track background helped Tarry Blylen pull a 556 deadlift also at 165. Debby Swanson at 181 raw made 485-290 and a 540 deadlift. Sue Meany was the first woman to squat 500, bench 300, and pull 500. Karen Sizemore benched 450, squatted 650 with a 500 pull. All total, Westside has had seven women pull 500 or more. Mariah Leggett at 132 pulled 484 and dominated the 132 and 148 in the 80s and 90s. My wife, Doris, won six WPC Worlds and for years held all-time squat, bench, and totals at 105. This was after she won the Miss Ohio State Bodybuilding title. The Late Karen Michael trained at Westside and made the famous Karen Bench press shirts. Our women team won the women's team title at the WPC Worlds, winning every class but the 181 class as Sorenson sat on the side line. In 1986 Westside owned a commercial gym by accident, but that accident turned into a positive. It opened the door for many men and women who would be very successful and some famous by breaking world record holders. Ken Patterson, George Halbert, Chuck Vogipaol, Joe Mccoy, Amy Wiesberber, Rob Fusner, Gerry O are names many will remember. All were national champs or world champs and many time world record holders. I still have lunch with Darrel Mayo after 35 years. This is a club. Joe and Mike Jester are still in the gym after more than 30 years and still training. In the very beginning-1974-we had a record board for the biggest meet lifts, a second board for the best coefficient lifts. Westside has almost 100 USPF Standard Elite Lifters who made their total at Westside. We have had the greatest bench pressers of all time along with five other men holding world records-this is all time. As well as six men holding all time world records in the squat, there are too many women to count to tally up. We currently have the greatest women Coefficients.\nLaura Phelps Sweat with 1,800 at 165. She alone has broken 34 all-time world records. She joined Amy Wiesberger holding three world record totals. Laura is a great ambassador to our sport as well as helping the Crossfit nation with great seminars with her husband Shane. Westside led the way with Chuck V. and Greg Panora. Then at 15 years old, Dave Hoff walked into Westside. Like Floyd Mayweather, he was surrounded by greatness. Three world record holders in the bench, and three world in the squat using the greatest system in the world and the constant over seeing by Bob Coe; the path was set. Like the others, I could see that he was special: A fast learner with the right proportions. But what I could not see at first was his mind. I have known the greatest of all time- first Larry Pacifico, then Mike Bridges he was unbelievable, lifting weights that were unheard of. He was the strongest man under 200 pounds. Next Ed Coan. I saw Ed come out of no where and beat Bobby Wahl at 165. Then, going up in weight to pull 793 at 181 twice in the same meet in Dayton. He did 859 at 198 and a mystical 901 at 220. Both men had a special mind set. I knew Mike used metaphysics and passed that advice onto me, but I was no bridges. Next up Shawn Frankel with today's gear making unreal weight: 1,055 squat and a 850 bench to total 2,630 at 198. This was Panoras world total at 242. He went on to total 2,715 at about 215. I thought the two coefficients totals would never be broken. I guess I forgot about Dave Hoff. After Donny Thompson made the historical 3,000 at the Powerstation Pro/am, one year later, Dave totaled 3,005 at 271. He recently broke his own 308 total doing 2,965 at 284. His stat's are too extensive to list, but he was the youngest to total 2,400 through 3,000 and has made a 2,900 total nine times so far. But look for more, many gyms are like a million, having a special one and a bunch of zeros. Westside is not one of those gyms. Men like Arnold Coleman setting world squat and total records. Phil Harrington breaking several world squat records at Westside, along with Chuck V setting squat records in three weight classes. Now, Wes Mccormick doing 900 at 165.\nJason Coker holds the world bench records at 181 and an incredible 900 at 198. At one time three men held world records at the same time Patterson, Halbert, and Rob Fusaer. Jay Fry came to Westside with a 525 bench at 181. As an experiment he used a bench shirt for 23 weeks and made his first 700 meet bench. Jay made two world records before hanging it up.\nWe have four men who total 2,800 or more and four have an over 900 deadlift. Our top 10 average is 866. So far 26 men have an over 1,000 squat , two with over 1,200, three bench over 900 and one is over 1,000 officially. AJ Roberts came with a 2,400 total and in three and a half years set three 308 world total records with best lifts adding up to 2,930.\nI just can't mention all of the great men and women that made Westside what it is today; there are too many. But, to end, I would like to thank Ken Patterson, Chuck V., George Halbert, JM Blakely, Rob Fusner, Joe Mccoy and Dave Zippy Tate for pushing to 57 years old making top 10 lifts. Westside made more than great lifters. It made great men known worldwide in fitness. First, Jim Wendler, an ex fullback in college and 1000 pound squatter. After retiring from Westside Jim wrote a very popular book entitled 5/3/1 that many have read. Its good to see Jim doing so well. Then, another author came out of Westside. His name is Brandon Lilly. After a good run at powerlifting, he started a system of Westside that called for less volume, called cube. It's a good system to be just good. We still see Brandon at meets, and he is still huge. Good luck Brandon. I was coming out of the Arnold classic after the WPO meet, ran by Karen Kidder with John Stafford leading the way when I heard someone call out “Mr. Simmons!” I turned around and saw a young man-it was Matt Wenning. He must have been a freshman in college at that time. I said, “Whats up?” He said he was a Westside fan from Ball State. His professor came to Westside years before after his time playing with the Cincinnati Bengals. I told him he could train at Westside whenever he could make the trip. After college he joined Westside for good. He became very strong after a few years. He began training military men and became very successful along with his personal training business.\nSoon after leaving Westside he broke the world 308 total record. It lasted a few minutes before his new training partner, Chuck Fold, pulled a massive deadlift to break his total record by five pounds! It is amazing how Matt made such a journey. The Westside system started in 1982 when Matt must have been three or four years old. But somehow with his desire, he finally crossed paths with Westside, and later after starting to expand his business, became highly respected. I hope the future is even brighter than the past. Good luck, Matt. The next man who has made a name for himself is Mark Bell. Mark came to train at Westside while trying out for the WWE. His personality was perfect for Pro Wrestling, but unfortunately he never made the cut. His promo tape had him beating up a guy and later seeing him again he beat him up again and said you're a two-time loser. That became his nickname. Oh, by the way, the guy he was beating up was his older brother Chris. Mark and Chris made a movie called bigger, faster, stronger. It covered the roid use in sports. It was very entertaining and to the point. Mark has a great gym. He says Super Training Gym is the strongest on the west coast. He also has a great magazine on powerlifting and strongman info called Power Magazine. And last, but not least, he invented the Slingshot, a device that assists a lifter in maintaining proper bench press form, while also allowing the lifter to overload either in weight or reps. It was very popular everywhere. I will never understand how a two-time loser became so great, but he did and I am proud to know him. Marcus Marinelli was also in the first group. While going to Ohio State he came to the garage to train. He became a top ten lifter after 716 at 212. While lifting not that long by some standards, he moved back to Cleveland and started doing MMA with Mark at his Karate studio, later becoming a very accomplished trainer.\nHe has a strong group of fighters led by the UFC heavyweight champ Stipe Miocic and a fine female fighter, Jessica “Evil” Eye. Marcus had completely dedicated his life to MMA. Marcus holds and operates Strong Style Mixed Martial Arts and Training Center a 30,000 square foot facility. I am very proud to know Marcus and watch how successful he has become. Marcus has just brought in three fighters from Westside to be on his team. With Marcus's drive, I can rest assured long after I am gone he will be developing more great fighters. Good luck, Marcus, and the strong style gang. The last, but certainly not least, is Dave Zippy Tate. To say “The lights are on, but no one's home” would be kind. He came to train at Westside after playing football. At first, he thought Westside was crazy, but after getting hurt, he found the light and started doing Westside. While training at Westside he began to sell Westside products, so he could start his own business EliteFts. It grew into a multi-million dollar business. Zippy was a great training partner. He was like Prince's mother-, never satisfied. And that's the story of Westside to this day; always wanting to achieve more and more. I will always respect the men who helped make Westside the club it is today. Everyone helped contribute during our countless experiments.\nAs long as there is a single breath in my body, Westside will continue to break records and lead the strength world in technology of special strength equipment. In closing, I would like to thank everyone who had entered the door of Westside and all of our Westside-certified gyms around the world and especially the conjugate gym owned by Laura and Shane Sweat in Cincinnati. This is just a little history of Westside Barbell, but to make history, you must look to the future. Louie Simmons",

A lifter from Indiana called Carlos Luper was very good making 650 pounds with no gear. The great Japanese lifter Inaba used a close stance sumo where he started his pull with arms between his legs, but finished with his arms outside of his legs.\nOur Mike Rogerio of Westside was a 300-pound super heavy weight and used the same close stance with hands outside the knees. All sports training starts with the basic lifts of Olympic and powerlifting.\nWhy use it for sports?\nIt is much safer on the low back due to emphasizing the legs, hips, and glutes with a straight back. The conventional style uses a lot of lower back, making a low back injury very possible.\nHow to execute a sumo deadlift\nI was taught by one of the greatest sumo technicians of all time, Mike Bridges.\nFirst, set your feet wide as possible—the wider the more hip and hamstring are doing the majority of the lift.\nNext, place your hands evenly on the bar. Most will grab the bar next to the knurling. There are four options to grab the bar: 1) Both hands over the knuckles facing forward, 2) Hook grip, but this can be painful on the thumbs, 3) Both hands over the bar with no hook, and 4) Use a reverse grip.\nNext, pull your hip into the starting position. This means not too low, but most will be in a half squat position. This is done by pushing your feet and knees out to the side. To start bar off the floor, push feet outward while pulling back, not up on the bar. This will start the hips coming forward while the shoulders are moving backward as you lock out the bar.\nThis style of deadlifting builds flexibility in the hips and groins, a plus for all sports. A bonus is great lateral speed by always pushing your feet apart. This is a great builder for the hamstrings, hips and glutes. Also, there are far more muscle activations than even squatting due to gripping the bar. When training for max strength, do one to five reps.\nFor explosive power, do 30 to 40 percent. For speed strength, use 75 to 85 percent mostly using reps one to three, but five also can be used. For maximal strength do one rep per set. For building muscle mass, one can do as many as 20 reps per set with light weight. Just like jumping squats, you can jump at the completion of your deadlift with light weights.\nI believe everyone should use briefs or tight shorts to protect the groin and hips. Your hips should not rise up first when pulling. This happens when you don’t push your knees out to the sides. This is caused by not forcing your feet out to the sides as well.\nIs there a training method to teach you to deadlift properly? Yes, but that’s another article. -Louie",

But now there is a drill to prevent this. It is called the seated deadlift.\nHow do you execute a seated deadlift?\nFirst, pick a chair or box to sit on about the height where your hips are when starting the bar off the floor. Next, while sitting on the box, place your feet in the same position as your normal start.\nThen, push your feet forward so the shin is angled forward not vertical. Grab the bar with an arched back and pull into a sitting position. This will cause the bar to push your knees outward as the bar is pulled into the seated position.\nThen, with the help of a partner, have them place a hand on your sacrum and one on your upper chest. Their job is to push the sacrum forward and the chest backward to a super-arched position.\nDo two or three seated reps. Then on the last seated rep, pause for about two seconds, then stand up. This should make your hips go forward coming toward the bar as your upper body is in an arched position, which is correct.\nYury Belkin is the one to watch. I found this out while watching the great Russian deadlifters and how they start the weights off the ground. It looks perfect at first, but right before starting the bar off the floor, they bring their hips even closer to the bar.\nThis is how it should be done.\nThe seated deadlift will do the trick.

There is, of course, a lot about box squatting.\nWe feel there is only one method to box squat, but many have these less effective methods. On the subject of the stretch reflex, however, someone said that the stretch reflex does not last four seconds as a study by Wilson (1990) states.\nI wrote a study with the use of a tendo unit on both eccentric and concentric phases. With all top ten lifters including two world-record holders. Two groups, one for speed strength where the velocity is about 0.8 m/s and near-maximal where the bar velocity was 0.4-0.5 m/s.\nI stated that I could sit on the box for eight seconds and concentrically rise at close to the speed of the eccentric phase. Dave Tate could do the same for five seconds.\nA Pete said the stretch reflex lasts only 0.025 seconds and I was incorrect due to the study by Siff and Verkhoshansky (1998).\nFirst, I believe Pete is referring to an amortization phase for a plyometric action. The box squat is not an example of a plyometric action. The length of the amortization phase when lowering very heavy weights will not be immediate as in a plyometric action, where the delay can be as short as 0.15 seconds between the eccentric and a subsequent concentric contraction. A study by Wilson (1990) concluded that while bench pressing, the stretch would last up to four seconds. At that point all started elastic energy is lost. Other studies by Chapman and Caldwell (1985) found it to be the same as Pete—0.25 seconds and the plyometric action is lost. But, in 1982 Bosco found how both could be correct.\nHe found that those with a very high rate of fast-twitch fiber would lose the rebound. This would explain why Tate could only hold the position for five seconds while I held it for eight seconds.\nA second factor could be joint mobility and the maximum delays for each joint action. While Chapman and Caldwell tested the forearm, the box squat done the Westside way is a multi-joint activity, where there is stored elastic energy in all three simultaneously.\nAs you can imagine, the mass of knees, hips, and back would hold many times the amount of forearm action. I don’t know whose forearm was tested, but our study was with several world record holders.\nThe age of our participants was 22 to 50 years. The author was 50 at the time of the study and had the second highest squat on the top 10. This means the group was very talented, not merely students or novices. This could explain the results.\nWhen depth jumps are performed, the reversible muscular action is limited to the feet.\nBut, when box squatting, according to physical principles, the amount of stored energy is proportional to the applied force and the induced deformation. Deformation is the stretch shortening cycle during the support phase while running.\nThe same stretch-shortening cycle happens during the support while sitting on the box. There are many reasons to box squat, but think about why Westside releases the hip muscles after coming into contact. Let's compare the mass of your foot while running, then the mass of your body sitting on a box. Wait, there is no comparison. We know that the stiffness of a tendon is constant, but the stiffness of a muscle can vary depending on the forces exerted. Elite athletes like the ones in the Westside study, have found ways to use this stored elastic energy for overcoming a large load while sitting on the box.\nMost of our training is a combination of bar weight plus elastic bands, which sometimes are greater than the amount of weight on the barbell. The bands are pulling the barbell down at a faster rate than lowering just barbell weight. This produces a greater stretch reflex due to causing a faster eccentric phase.\nNow let's look at elasticity and Hooke’s law. Hooke’s law states that the amount of deformation produced by a force is proportional to the amount of force. Now, clear your mind and think about Hooke’s law and box squatting concerning deformation.\nIf the amount of deformation produced by a force is proportional to the amount of force, what if you have a very strong man producing great force downward on a basketball causing great deformation, caused by the flattening on the bottom of the ball.\nThen suddenly, sliding his hands off the ball, it would rebound upward due to its elasticity properties. A similar action happens when one slowly releases muscle while sitting on the box. Both will switch from an eccentric or lowering to concentric rising.\nThe box squat uses a combination of the two greatest methods of strength training: Relaxed overcome by a dynamic action and static overcome by a dynamic action. While the muscles are relaxing, the tendons are maximally loaded.\nThis is a skill and it must be learned correctly. This is also why Westside achieves great results by sitting on a box. Just like box squatting, but when rocking back, pick the feet up and slam them down while rocking forward during the jump phase while box jumping. I hope this explains how one can sit on a box for a long time period and concentrically raise at the same rate of speed as touching and going method.\nThere is much information in super-training about reversible strength. On page 219 there is a training device that lets a barbell fall. The athlete must first stop it from falling and immediately throw it upward.\nThe idea is that the muscular force developed at the instant of going from eccentric to concentric work will be greater for a shorter amortization phase and a shorter braking time. But if you constantly add weight to the falling bar, the amortization phase will be longer and longer.\nTo build kinetic energy in the body it is best to add velocity, not mass. But one truly amazing method is the static overcome by dynamic method. Westside had developed a training device that's purpose is to build maximal muscle tension on a non-moveable bar.\nThe bar can be loaded to any weight but for explosive strength use 30 to 40 percent of a 1RM at any position from the bottom to near the top. To perform a rep, pull or push on the bar while it is locked in place for two to six seconds as powerfully as possible.\nNow by releasing a brake, the light load will explode upwardly at high velocity. It can be held for a longer period if breath is not held. There is no eccentric phase to this method, yet one can overcome the load on the barbell at great velocity.\nWhen box squatting, the eccentric concentric phase is broken. This can explain why even after sitting on the box for sometime, a rapid concentric action is possible.\nI hope the examples I have shown will explain how we could maintain the same concentric speed after a long pause up to eight seconds compared to a one second pause.

He holds world records at 181 of 771 pounds and at 198 of 900 pounds and he is the former world record holder at 220 with 903 pounds.\nBut the real story is how Jason pushed his squat from 920 to 950 pounds at 181 and to 1,000 pounds at 220 and a 1,035 pound at 220 pounds after moving to Westside. His deadlift was a very meager 560 until the training at Westside helped raise it to 630 pounds at 220 pounds. Two things that are critical: his training methods and his training partners.\nLet's look at the squat workout. It is a three-week pendulum wave that is constantly rotated year-round with just barbell weight. It is 75, 80, and 85 percent each week jumping 5 percent.\nThis helps avoid accommodation by altering the volume. And the intensity on the fourth week the bar weight is rolled back to 75 percent with a change in bars. Jason rotated from a bulldog to a safety squat to a bow and last a 14-inch chambered bar. This causes a new physical task to which the body must accustom itself.\nThis also works to avoid accommodation on speed strength day. This has worked for 26 1,000-pound or greater as well as six men breaking world records in the squat. To make progress at the very top first you must constantly raise volume at the correct bar speed. A bar speed of 0.9 m/s this builds speed strength.\nNow, lets calculate the total volume for his 1,000-pound squat as Jason trains the squat by box squatting. Westside does five sets of five reps now. The reason is the fifth rep is as fast as the set of two reps. Week 1_500 x 5 sets of 5 reps x 250 BT = Volume 18,750\nWeek 2_550 x 5 sets of 5 reps x 250 BT = Volume 20,000\nWeek 3_600 x 5 sets of 5 reps x 250 BT = Volume 21,250 This is very high volume, but to lift at a high level this must be done to achieve record-breaking pace. After the speed squats, 20 speed strength deadlifts are performed with 50 percent bar weight and 30 percent band tension. This adds to 80 percent at lockout. Jason uses 315 plus 220-pound band tension.\nThis is about 85 percent at lockout for Jason’s pulls. This is about 10,700 pounds of speed pulls. Add this to his squat volume and it adds up to the average intensity of 80 percent. It is 30,700 pounds. His total volume is 150,000 pounds per workout. The speed pulls are done both sumo style and conventional style.\nHe pulls sumo style. Three main things that have raised his squat and deadlift: 1) widening his stance to force the hips into play, 2) learning to box squat correctly (Meaning releasing the hips and sitting back on the box, then squatting straight up), and 3) the small special exercises like reverse hypers®, inverse curls, ATP belt squat machine, back raises, and Goodmornings. If you want to raise your top squat and deadlift, don’t squat and deadlift more, but train your back and legs separately. Max Effort Workout\nJason squats on Friday and pulls. Monday is his max effort day. The extreme workouts must be about 72 hours apart. The workout will benefit both the squat and the deadlift. The large barbell exercise is always rotated each week in no certain way.\nHere is a list of max effort workouts that Jason and his training partners use. Low box squat close stance. It can be a safety squat bar, bow bar, 14-inch chamber bar and even front squat with our special harness. Mostly just barbell weight but 200 or 300 pound of chain is also used. It can also be done with very heavy band tension. The band tension can range from 375 pounds to 700 pounds at times\nGoodmornings are a main stay at Westside. Many styles are used from arched back, legs bent or straight to round back, legs bent or straight. Concentric Goodmornings are done off supportive chairs or off rack pins. A special good morning box squat is a regular for Jason. It is done two ways. One way is to lower with a round back, sit on a box, arch back, and squat up. The second method is to lower with back arched, sit on box, roll forward, round over, and stand up.\nMax effort deadlift method. Rack pulls. Three pins are used with the plates 2.5-inch, 4.5-inch, and 6.5-inch off the floor. Just barbell weight is used or for our 700-pound up to 900-pound deadlifters, they use 250-pound or 350-pound bands tension. This is max effort work, meaning work up to a new personal record for one rep. Mostly conventional stance.\nBox Deadlift. Jason has a record while standing on a two-inch or a four-inch box. Close stance on two-inch or four-inch box.\nSumo on a two-inch box. Other times the plates are on a two-inch or four-inch mats. While standing on a box, it is used to build leg drive. When the plates are on a two-inch or four-inch mat, it takes leg drive out of the lift, forcing the back to do most of the work. When box is on the platform, bands are on bar.\nHe uses 220-pound with mini bands, 280-pounds with monster mini bands. Both sumo and conventional styles are used. Always keep records. No one at Westside does power cleans or power snatch, but if you like, do them for max effort. Jason will build his flexibility by doing chair deadlifts. Jason does many stances from heels touching to ultra wide sumo deadlift. This covers most of his max effort barbell exercises.\nSmall Special Exercises\nSmall special exercises comprise 80 percent of Jason’s total volume.\nHe does two exercises that are high volume, but are also used for traction for fast recovery. He does these exercises in our ATP, a special belt squat machine. One exercise is a static hold in the belt squat machine, because a static hold will radiate 15 degrees in both directions. Some holds are at parallel with wide and close stance.\nHe also does holds in the half-squat position with a wide or close stance. He holds with the most weight at lockout or near lockout. The bottom is held for 30 seconds, the half squat for 30 seconds, and the top for one to two minutes. This can be done due to not holding your breath. A second method is to deadlift while belt squatting.\nThis builds both leg drive and all the back muscles at two accelerations. Both sumo and close stance are done. He also does box squatting with the belt squat with just the cable or with both the cable and a bar on his back or front squat.\nNext, reverse hypers® are done with 400 to 480 pounds for 100 to 120 reps. This builds great strength while working as one of the best traction devices known. While both the belt squat and the reverse hyper® are multi-muscle builders, the next exercise isolates the hamstrings like no other. It is the inverse curl®.\nThis machine will make it possible to do Russian leg curls in just a few months by reducing the weight on the machine until you are doing a bodyweight Russian leg curl. All three exercises make it possible to gauge how strong a single muscle group is. Jason starts each workout with abs and abs are also the last thing he does. Last but not least is GPP for fitness and recovery.\nJason pulls a weight sled for trips of 60 yards. Six to 10 trips are common. He will also push our war wagon, a special wheelbarrow, for the same amount of trips instead of pulling a sled. He does some upper body sled work on off days or for his second small workout.\nWell, this covers most of his work for the squat and deadlift. Look for even bigger things for Jason in the future as there is a lot left in the Coke machine.\nLouie",

This leads to a high level of general physical preparedness.\nThe Westside system calls for four standard workouts: two for the upper body and two for the lower body. Westside does not do a block of training restoration work after a period of high volume along with high intensity, but rather continuously does several small special workouts or back restoration. Recovery is essential to all athletes, but more so to the powerlifter that places very large, if not, critical loads on the spine. One must also regain energy. There must be rest between workouts. For extreme workouts, 72 hours of rest between workouts is necessary. Small workouts can be done every 12 to 24 hours.\nThe workouts that occur every 12 to 24 hours are the mainstay of Westside success. We have a list of 26 1,000-plus lifters, two with over 1,200-pound squats and 25 with 800-pound deadlifts, plus four over 900 pounds, all with healthy backs.\nWhen constantly lifting extreme loads, the first thing Westside maintains is spinal traction. Westside athletes use two types of inversion tables several times a week while at Westside. At home they will lie on the floor face-up with their feet and legs on the seat of the chair with their legs bent. Many can hang from a chin-up bar, but not everyone can relax while hanging.\nOn occasion, they visit our chiropractor and use a split table with the traction force up to 100 kg. All of the above procedures will help pain, flexibility, and posture. Special attention is paid to the iliopsoas. It must be stretched or released by our ART therapist. If the iliopsoas is tight, it can cause one to bend over forward as there is no opposing muscle to keep proper posture.\nYou must learn to hold your air when lifting heavy loads. This will increase intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). To learn how, push out on your powerbelt not only to the front, but also the sides. We are referring to the valsalva maneuver.\nTry lying down and placing a weight or medicine ball on your stomach and try to raise the resistance by expanding your stomach. Also, walk with a medicine ball while holding it against your stomach. For the prevention of lower back injuries, the abs must be extremely strong.\nLook at the list of ab exercises below:\n-side bends\n-incline sit-ups\n-straight leg sit-ups\n-hanging leg raise\n-lying leg raise\n-weight sled walking with strap around ankle\n-zercher lift\n-lifting without a belt with caution\n-twisting\nThese are just a few examples.\nA popular exercise on a strap model builds not only the rectus abdominis muscle, but also the deep muscles of the lumbar. Especially the epaxial muscles, which are hard to activate with regular training. There are two common methods: 1) stand against a wall and try to push your lower back into the wall, or 2) if the first is too difficult, mount a reverse hyper with a strap.\nPlace toes against plates and push plates forward and restrict the reverse motion for high reps to failure. This exercise has a great effect on the deep muscles underneath the spinal erectors and will correct pelvic tilt. These two exercises build unheard of strength, while also acting as restoration. At Westside we never do rehab because we do prehab all the time.\nOne exercise is the reverse hyper. While doing reverse hypers with light or heavy weights, the movement will rotate the lower back in an open chain method. By lying on the table with the legs hanging downward, traction of the spine occurs. At the same time, the arms are also causing traction due to being stretched in the opposite direction when doing the exercise.\nWhen lying on the table on your stomach, your I.A.P. is raised, aiding in reducing pressure on the discs, as well as increasing disc hydration. Westside total volume on reverse hypers is four times the squat volume. This is done in sets of 20 reps. The weight is 50 percent of your squat on all reverse hypers with the exception of the Bent Pendulum, which is mechanically much more difficult.\nReverse hypers are done four times a week on squat and deadlift days, Monday and Friday, with heavy weights. On bench days, Wednesday and Saturday, reverse hypers are done with 50 percent of the top weight for two sets of 25 or 30 reps.\nWhile it is said that 44 percent to 50 percent of all athletes have lower back pain, Westside has virtually none. Your abs and lower back must be as strong as possible. This requires finding a way to train the lower back extensively. The answer: reverse hypers along with back raises and high rep Goodmornings with a bar, rubber bands, or a Goodmorning machine. The second method to build a strong back and work as restoration is the Westside Athletic Training Platform or ATP, a special patented belt squat device. Science and Practice of Strength Training tells us it is necessary to greatly reduce the load falling on the lumbar section of the spine and to strengthen the lower back muscles.\nThe ATP greatly reduces the spinal load, while maximally strengthening the legs, glutes, and hips to the extreme. It uses a belt fixed around the waist that provides spinal traction, while allowing great muscle tension from the feet completely to the legs, hips, glutes, and lower back and abs. Westside has used weights in excess of 2,000 pounds. The massive weights are for building unbelievable squats and pulls.\nWhen using light weights for isometric holds or walking in place for spinal traction, this method is more and more common in chiropractic and therapy centers for rehabilitation.\nThe special belt produces increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), while simultaneously producing great special traction.\nWhen one has handled maximal loads while squatting, holding the weight at the start of the lift feels very heavy before bending the knees. The isometric holds will change this completely.\nWestside has trained children as young as seven-years-old on the ATP for preparing them for all sports, as it builds all the lower body muscles including the abs. Before going on to a very important element of back health, there are many types of special therapies and many times the practitioner will convince you their method is best. However, in most cases it could take several methods concurrently to restore you back to health. Hamstring Training\nLet’s talk hamstrings. If your low back is tight, it is a safe bet that your hamstrings are also tight, causing low back pain as well. A bilateral deficit can cause an imbalance, while performing sports activities that include squatting, running, jumping, and pulling and pressing overhead.\nThis can cause low back pain. The bilateral of seven percent can cause injury or a hamstring ratio of less than 40 percent of the quads can also cause injury. A female sprinter and world record holder in the squat was tested at The Ohio State University with 60 percent hamstring and 40 percent quads.\nThis, to date, was the highest such ratio ever tested at O.S.U. In untrained athletes using bilateral movements, the total force produced is less than the sum of both left and right limbs (Henry & Smith 1961, Coyle 1984-1987). To correct this, single leg jumps and step-ups can be entered into training for the legs. One arm presses at different angles are used. Also, one arm push-ups or pull-down are done.\nHere’s how to train the hamstrings: Multi-joint exercises are used first. Squatting correctly, meaning sitting back as the first movement in the exercise, engages the glutes and hamstrings.\nThe Goodmorning is also excellent for building the hamstrings. To begin a Goodmorning one must first push the glutes to the rear to activate the hamstrings and then bend over with an arches or a round upper back only. To return, you must apply force to the bar to come erect. This places a great force on the hamstrings. Regular deadlifts apply the same force on the hamstrings as stiff-leg style. Next Use Small Special Exercises\nRegular lying leg curls are our least-used exercise at Westside, as this action is not used in sports activities. A sport activity produces stress on the hamstring at the knee and the glute tie-end simultaneously.\nThe lying hamstring curl does not. I will save the best for last, but here is a list: calf-ham-glute raises (high reps for conditioning or low reps with resistance for two to six reps, use single or both legs), standing leg curl (this really hits the lower hamstring for knee flexion). The standing leg curl is a single-leg exercise.\nThe Westside patented INVERSE CURL™ simulates a Russian leg curl where one holds your ankles while lying face down on the floor and leg curls up to your knees without a push-up with your hands. Almost no one can do a single rep.\nThe Inverse is engineered to use a counterweight to lighten the body enough to do a full rep correctly. After mastering your weight plus the extra weight, start reducing the weight on the weight arm slightly week after week until you are using only the support arm. Only at that point is it time to drop the arm to the ground and do a legitimate Russian leg curl.\nWestside's latest intern, Courtney, came to Westside with a 255 squat and a 205 deadlift. At that time she used 35 pounds on the inverse curl. Six weeks later she squatted 330 pounds and deadlifted 310 pounds standing on a two-inch mat. This is a direct parallel result to her performance on the inverse curl.\nAfter picking one or two major hamstring exercises, Westside will do 100 or 200 reps of leg curls with ankle weights or rubber bands. The ankle weights can range from five pounds to 20 pounds and the band curls can be performed with mini bands up to the strong bands, for the very large, very strong athletes. Don’t forget to stretch your calves. Tight calves can have an effect on a tight back if they are not lengthening properly. Louie",

His top squat was 750 pounds. His bench was 570 pounds. He had a 1,920-pound total at 242 pounds.\nIt took only four months for him to total 2,075 pounds doing an 835-pound, 605-pound, and an opener 635-pound. Was it geography or a training system that was tailored to his needs? It was the system—the Westside system—using a three-week pendulum wave for his periodization model; the introduction of small special exercises through the conjugate system that controls volume, intensity, and constantly changing velocity of the barbell; and improved restoration methods.\nFirst, let’s look at his squat and deadlift training.\nIn the past, the Westside protocol had been doing 12 sets of two reps for the first two weeks and 10 sets of two on week three to maintain the proper amount of volume to make it possible to raise your squat on meet day.\nBut, without change you fail due to being complacent. To raise Westside’s squat we now do five sets of five reps in speed strength workouts with the same percentages—50, 55, and 60 percent—in three-week pendulum waves.\nThe first goal was to use the correct percentages. For his 750-pound squat for the first three-week wave his training weights were 375, 415, and 450 pounds. After making rapid progress on the second wave, he used 400, 440, and 480 pounds. This was 50 to 60 percent of 800 pounds.\nAgain, his progress was fast and he moved on to use 850 pounds as the logical goal. For the rest of the waves he used 425, 465, and 510 pounds. The rest intervals were about 2½ minutes. At these weights, his speed was very good due to working on his lacking muscle groups.\nAfter all speed strength squat workouts, the speed pulls were done with 330 pounds plus 30 percent band tension at lockout. Both sumo and conventional styles were rotated to cover all muscle groups.\nBy doing five sets of five reps, muscle tension was prolonged, but without weight gain. Also, the fifth rep was the same speed as the second rep that was previously used.\nThe same reasoning was used with the speed pulls—going from eight to 10 singles to five sets of four reps. All reps are pause on the floor. And the volume is doubled to increase your lifts and total, one must assess volume systematically.\nBy adding 10 speed pulls on Friday’s speed strength workout, it had no ill-effect on recovery going forward to max effort day 72 hours later on Monday.\nTravis had never concerned himself with 80 percent of his training with small special exercises. By training with this in mind, Travis had brought his lacking muscle groups to equal strengths. Now no sore muscles caused by one muscle group doing more than its share.\nThe special exercises used were Goodmornings, all types of rowing, back raises, standing leg curls, reverse hypers, calf-ham-glute raises, athletic training platform, weight sled pulls, and heavy abs and side bends.\nGeneral Physical Preparation (GPP) is a key to lacking muscle groups and volume and improving recovery.\nHis GPP also consisted of walking with a wheelbarrow and doing two extra workouts for the squat and deadlifts. Lots of leg curls with ankle weights or banded leg curls, calf work, neck work, grip work, and always exercises counting side bends were included as well.\nBench workout\nTravis needed more upper body muscle. Speed benching was replaced with an old bench program Bill Seno from Chicago put me onto in the early 1970’s. First, Travis did 6x6 reps with the weight going up each week until it became difficult. At that time, the weight was reduced and an 8x8 program began.\nAgain, weight went up week after week until no more progress could be made. The third leg of this program is 10x10 reps where after reducing the weight again and working up for a few weeks until once more, no progress can be made.\nNow Travis goes back to 6x6 reps and the wave cycle goes on and on. After going back to the six reps, he exceeded what he did on the first cycle of six reps. This brought his bench up from 570 pounds to 605 pounds at the meet. After the bench sets are done, two or three sets of dumbbell presses are done for 15 or 20 reps. For each workout, the angle is changed.\nNext, triceps are worked with as much work as possible on each day. Dumbbell roll backs or elbows out extensions are two of Travis’ favorites. Barbell extensions are done with many different bars: E-Z curl, football, T-bar, chambered bar, and also straight bench bars. To end the workout, Travis trains his rear, side, and front delts.\nHis upper back and lats are trained as well. This is the true foundation of pressing. Speed bench is on Saturday and max effort is on Wednesday. As far as shirt benching is concerned, Travis uses it on average, every three or four weeks.\nThe other max effort workouts are worked for a 1RM. For each workout it could be rack press, band press, chain press, board press, incline press, floor press, decline press, or wide and close grip. Records are kept. On both max effort days, Travis and his teammates break new records at a rate close to 95 percent.\nThe teammates help Travis a lot with advice and encouragement. Travis is now a real member, now making over an 800-pound squat or a 600-pound bench and at least a 2,000-pound total. Watch Travis and see what he does next meet. I am sure it will be much more.\nRemember the title “Geography 101?” What is the difference between living in Seattle, Washington and Columbus, Ohio?\nWestside Barbell\nGood luck,\nLouie",

What are you trying to achieve? Do you want to become stronger and lift larger weights, but not necessarily gain weight by building larger muscles, or do you want to do body building to build bigger muscles?\nWhile Westside does not participate in bodybuilding events, we can help you to understand the differences between pure strength training and bodybuilding. A bodybuilder’s main objective is to gain muscle mass.\nBodybuilders must train on isolation exercises. Many of the exercises are on machines. Remember machines build muscle, but not motion. While bodybuilders’ muscles are much larger than a weight lifter’s, they are not pound for pound as strong. This is due to the lack of exercises that produce learning and improving coordination. This is not a mistake, but it is how bodybuilders must train to reach the highest standard possible. For the powerlifter or a weight lifter, the goal is to be as strong as possible at the lightest body weight. This is the goal for those of you competing in running events as well. A lifter or runner must learn skills and movements and coordination. The strength athlete must master many movements with more and more resistance.\nThere is no isolation in sports movements like lifting, jumping, or running. If Westside needs to add muscle mass to increase a lift, it has the lifter do small special exercises that concentrate on only a single muscle.\nThis means back or arm extensions or reverse hypers or hamstring curls on working with a calf-ham-glute device or an inverse or standing leg curl. This would hold true for lats or calves as well.\nOne must understand what percent of a 1RM builds what special strengths. Not only must you look at what percent, but at what velocity the resistance is moving. A young child of the untrained can gain a training effect with as little as 20 percent of their best effort (Siff, Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, 1999), while the advanced must use 80 percent of a 1RM for much of their training.\nWestside trains at 80 percent for the majority of their speed strength training for all their lifts. The Chinese and Russians train very close to Westside methods. For high level athletes, two methods are trained most often.\nThe most important workout is max effort. This workout calls for lifting as much as possible on that day. Westside rotates a new large barbell exercise each week on the squat-deadlift day. The same exercises will build both the squat or deadlift or Olympic lifts and all types of pressing. Max effort or maximal resistance permits only one rep. Remember in a contest you are required to only do a single.\nWhen doing a max effort workout you should break a personal record by a small amount, but try not to miss. Truly a max effort should be a near max, but not a failure.\nYour goal is to develop maximum force (Fmm); this means motion velocity is small.\nWhen doing submaximal efforts the repetitions are two to three reps, which builds maximal strength endurance, not maximal strength. Most often one will conserve your efforts to permit the lifter to do the second or third rep. This method will not permit the athlete from using the maximal number of muscle units. The above two methods should be performed in TFmm, meaning training maximum efforts with little or no emotion. If the contest maximum (CFmm ) is used too often in training, it can result in being burned out, causing tiredness, high blood pressure at rest, anxiety, and other staleness syndrome. In a monthly plan, 12 lifts are used for max or near maximal attempts for the squat and pulls, and 12 lifts are also used for pressing.\nSpeed strength training is 72 hours later with reps ranging from four to seven lifts. Westside uses five to six reps at a pace of 0.8 m/s. The volume is high for squat: 25 lifts and 20 pulls. A monthly plan is 100 lifts for squat and 80 lifts for pulls. That's a total of 180 lifts for speed strength with intermediate velocity.\nThis is quite a contrast to a max effort monthly plan where only 12 lifts are performed in a monthly plan. This plan prevents accommodation through loading—high barbell volume on speed strength day compared to low barbell volume on max effort day. On both days the ratio of classical barbell lifts is 20 percent compared to 80 percent small special exercises.\nResearch by Naglak (1979) characterized all resistance noted in this article. He described the majority of training with resistance ranging from eight to 12 as moderately heavy. Moderate resistance is characterized as 13 to 18 reps. Light resistance is described as 19 to 25 reps and very light resistance over 25 up to 100 reps.\nFor safety we do not use a barbell for reps for the repeated effort method. This method calls for one to perform a set to complete failure because the body does not divide the forces equally on all body parts. The weakest muscle group will fatigue first, which can cause an injury. Most of Westside’s training calls for single-joint training.\nSingle-joining training means extensions for the hips, arms, back; curls for the arms and legs; raises for the delts, abs, and so forth. This single method is much safer and can reduce muscle imbalances to produce strength and size if needed where needed.\nThis helps muscle recruitment leading to the size principle that causes recruitment of both fast- and slow-twitch fibers. Most of the work with reps between eight to 25 reps are done with dumbbells or a special machine.\nVery light resistance starting at 25 and up to 100 reps are intended to build strength in not only the muscles but the tendons, ligaments, and bones by stimulating blood flow in these areas by using rubber bands. This is just a modest review of how to build eccentric, concentric strength as well as building isometric strength.\nWhen trying to build muscle or develop a special strength, you must know what velocity to use at a certain intensity zone as well as the correct rep range.\nMore can be found by reading: The Science of Sports Training by Thomas Kurz Science and Practice of Strength Training by V.

I am constantly asked “Why does Westside do this or do that?” Why, why, why!\nWhen asked “How did you come to the conclusion about training methods and exercises you use at Westside?,” I decided it was time to write this article.\nWe reached our conclusions after using a combination of Soviet training mythologies and special exercises developed at Westside dating back to 1982. Then, we used nothing but top 10 lifters, many who were or are all-time world record holders, for many experiments that lasted up to 18 months to verify the results. Here is a list of reasons we use certain methods. Why use a pendulum wave for speed strength for the classical lifts? This approach to training by Arosiev suggested this type of planning for all special strengths. This can be found in Supertraining (Siff, Verkhoshansky, 2009). It was used for team sports that required sportsmen to maintain a certain level of strength. In the book, Managing the Training of Weightlifters (1982) A. Sprilepin shows data from 1974 that showed the minimal, optimal, and maximal number of lifts at a certain percentage. If you are training for speed strength where the average speed would be about 0.8m/s, Westside does 25 lifts per workout. D. Ermakov and N. S. Atarasov’s 1975 data showed for 50 percent of their training doing between 75 and 85 percent. Russia, China, and Westside came to the same conclusion based on 780 highly skilled weight lifters. Westside uses 50-55-60 percent bar weight and 25 percent band tension at lockout. This adds up to 75, 80, and 85 percent at lockout. On the fourth week, go back to 50 percent and start a second wave. All the weights with maximal speed will build speed strength. We use a pendulum wave because there are no wasted reps. Westside is always evolving and found that our lifters can perform five reps at the same speed as two reps. The result, a world record 900 at 105 pounds and a 1,035 at 220 pounds and a squat increase of 165 pounds going from 900 to 1,065 pounds at 242 in five months. For explosive strength use 30 to 40 percent and the optimal number of lifts are 36 lifts, six sets of six reps is optimal with two-minute rest intervals. For recovery, the volume, intensity, and velocity are kept perfect. Now on the fourth, switch bars if possible. This is only 20 percent of our training. Why use max effort and why not a two or three or five rep max? Let's start with the phrase maximal effort method. It is singular, not plural. This means one rep or a maximal exertion under an isometric condition or in a very slow movement against a maximal load. Remember in a contest of any of the five classical lifts, you do a single, not two or more reps. This builds strength endurance and is referred to as the submaximal effort method. The max effort method is considered best for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. Remember, if you tackle a football player it is a maximal effort. If you run through the line, it is a maximal effort or you are sitting on the bench. This method brings the greatest increases in strength by using the most motor units. Know this, your body adapts only to the demand placed upon it. This method is intended for large barbell exercises: squats, pulls, Goodmornings.\nIt is not for isolation exercises like sit-ups, leg curls, arm curls, or calf raises. It is used by top athletes who have been taught good techniques, but Westside starts lifters as young as 14 using max effort workouts. But only after a large GPP background. Two examples are Kenny Patterson, who started at 14 and became open world record holder at just 20 years old. Also, Dave Hoff started at 15 and squatted 1,005 at 19 and a 2,435 total at 252 body weight.\nHe became the youngest to total 24-25-26-27-28-29 and 3,000 with no history of injuries. There are two max effort methods. First, you do a training max without exhibiting high emotion. A contest max is done with high emotional state while competing.\nWhen doing more than 1 rep, it is the muscles you are training, not the movement. For the same lift, 72 hours should separate the dynamic method day and the max effort day. The max effort day is low volume with the barbell, but at the highest intensity possible on that day.\nThe Russians, Chinese, and Westside count only all-time records in the classical and special exercises, small and large. It accounts for about 600 new records a year. The Bulgarian system calculated the highest weight lifted on a daily basis. It could account for about 4,000 maxes a year in both classical and special squats, pulls, and small special exercises.\nFor sports I have seen an athlete do a set of five jumps onto a 53-inch box. This means they conserved their force production to do five jumps and never produced a force great enough to jump on a 53-inch box. You must learn to produce maximal force on a single attempt. In sports this is a must for blocking a punt, getting a rebound, or spiking on a volleyball court.\nFor more info, read Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. M. Zatsiorsky (1995). Why Compensatory Acceleration Training (CAT)? The late Dr. Red Hatfield (a.k.a. Dr. Squat) brought to my attention in the 1970s that one must accelerate throughout the full range of motion or the total force value is lost to some extent. To train for a fast rate of force development (R.F.D.) it is recommended to use weights ranging from 30 to as high as 70 percent of a 1RM. For explosive strength this is high velocity 75 to 85 percent; for speed strength this is intermediate velocity. Strength speed or slow strength requires one to use a much higher percentage of band tension over barbell weight. Here’s an example: A.J. Roberts during a strength speed phase made a box squat with 700 pounds of band tension, plus 510 pounds of barbell weight that equals 1,210 pounds. During the circamax phase, AJ made 740-pound barbell weight plus 440-pound band tension that equals 1,180 pounds. On meet day AJ made a 1,205-pound meet personal record. For abrupt loading place bands over the plates as well as over the bar. A second method of abrupt loading is to use 200 pounds or 300 pounds of chain that unloads in the bottom of the squat plus bands over the bar. We know by reading Supertraining that the amount of force a muscle can produce changes with different joint angles. It states that the greatest force possible is after the joint passes through the halfway point of the movement. This means that no matter how fast you push after the sticking point the weight becomes easy and the amount of force is decreased due to joint angles. Biomechanically the Fmm is a combination of muscular forces or tensions that undergo two transformations according to The Science and Practice of Strength Training—one joint movement and muscular forces which transform into external force.\nThere are different muscular forces as body positions change. Remember CAT: when using less than a maximal load the Fmm will decrease at the end of the movement regardless. This is illustrated on page 40 figure 2.20 in Science and Practice of Strength Training. It shows the maximal isometric force Fmm to the bar at different body positions. This also happens while doing sports that require rowing, kicking or throwing.\nCAT makes it possible to produce an increased muscle tension by moving the load as fast as possible throughout the entire range of motion. Why do you use Accommodating Resistance (AR)? The theory of CAT is good but somewhat incomplete. Go back to page 40 figure 2.20 in Science and Practice of Strength Training. It clearly shows that force changes as the bar travels through the full range of motion. But the problem is that it decreases near the end of the lift. You have all missed a lift at near lockout. Figure 2.20 shows why, but how can this be corrected in training? The answer is by using some method of variable resistance. One may think of authors Gones and Nacticus and their machines with their variable lever arms. As early as 1879 Zander developed a strength device to develop maximal tension throughout the full range of motion. One method of variable resistance is isokinetic. With an isokinetic device the speed of motion is constant no matter how much force is developed. Let’s talk about different velocities. Motion velocity decreases as external resistance increases and inversely, maximum velocity Vmm is achieved when external resistance is close to 0, according to V.M. Zatsiorsky in The Science and Practice of Strength Training.\nThe best method of A.C. Westside found is attaching chains or bands to the bar. The amount of chains or bands you add to the bar will determine the special strength you want to develop. For explosive strength where velocity is high, the total bar weight can range from 30 to 60 percent made up of mostly chain or band resistance or both. For speed strength, 25 percent of the load is made up with chain or band tension at lockout. Remember, you must have some amount of chain weight or band tension at the bottom of the lift.\nFor near maximal weight ranging from 90 to 97 percent for circa-max training, the band tension is 39 to 47 percent. For example, for those who squat in the 700 to 800 pound range the band tension is 375 pounds. If you box squat 500 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension you should squat 800 pounds at meet time. A 550-pound box squat plus 375-pound band tension, you will squat 850 pounds.\nWith a 600-pound box squat with 375-pound band tension you will squat 900 pounds. Use the same band tension with a 650-pound box squat will render a 950 pound meet squat. A 1,000-pound squat on meet day is possible after a 600-pound box squat with 440 pounds of band tension. To prove this, Westside has more than 80 800-pound squatters and over a 1,000-pound squat.\nNow back to AR. Chains provide AR by first deloading on the eccentric phase, then reloading on the concentric phase. This is the most natural way to provide AR. Band tension has an added bonus, as it provides an overspeed eccentric phase. This is very important as it increases kinetic energy (K-E). This helps the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC). Many think of depth jumps for training the SSC, but there are others.\nA plyo swing can build reversible muscle action. Westside had a patented plyoswing that loads weight plates plus bands to increase velocity. To increase kinetic energy it is better to increase velocity rather than mass. A plyometric action that requires an amortization phase, also called the shock absorption, lasts only 0.15 seconds between the eccentric and concentric phases. But when sitting on a box or a floor press done correctly, meaning relaxing the muscle while contacting the floor for a brief time, it lasts up to four seconds due to deformation. This is due to muscle and tendon elasticity.\nRubber bands work similar to the muscle and tendon, adding more elasticity that plays an important role in raising motor output in all sport movements. This is due to stored energy that is equal to the amount of force applied on the eccentric phase that causes deformation. This happens during the support phase while running.\nWhat if a large man pushed down on a rubber basketball until it flattens out say three inches? Then he slides his hands off the ball very fast? It jumps off the floor due to stored elasticity. This is what happens when one absorbs the resistance on the eccentric phase. So you see, bands work best for variable resistance, but also for adding K-E with overspeed eccentrics, while building, and to some extent, changing the strength curves.\nIt has been said that with lifts that involve many body parts, chains won’t work. They are wrong. Glen Pendley and Travis Mash, two highly qualified Olympic weightlifting coaches have used chains for the two Olympic lifts. The chains must be loaded by using a support set of ¼-inch chain to hold the ⅝-inch chains so they have contact with the platform at all times. Look how Westside places chains on the barbell. Bands work even better by preventing the force that is applied to the bar from diminishing as the bar reaches the top of the pull. Glen Pendley says it is great for pulling throughout the snatch. Bands can be used on all five classical lifts. You can see an AR device for the Olympic lifts in the 1983 weightlifting yearbook by Bud Charniga Jr. Westside has been using chains and bands on barbells for around 25 years and the author is credited with combinations of resistance methods in Supertraining. Why does Westside use delayed transformation? Starting in 1970 I would raise intensity and lower volume. It was a standard method of periodization leading up to a meet, sometimes referred to as Western Periodization. This was the only meet preparation known for American lifters. Its goals were to reach maximum intensity before a contest. But Western Periodization had a major flaw. While intensity was as high as possible at the most critical time, the volume had been reduced. This was the logic to allow one to focus on only the largest weights possible. But a lifter must maintain a certain fixed amount of volume to sustain a true maximal. It was suggested to drop all special exercises before the competition cycle. This was a major flaw as well. Why do special exercises that benefit your strength then drop them before a meet, the most important time for barbell volume. A 1,000 pound squat must maintain 21,250 pounds of volume up to 28 days out from the meet. This is backed up from Westside data collected from 26 men who squat 1,000 up to 1,210 pounds. Westside uses a 20 percent barbell to 80 percent special exercises ratio for our yearly plan. So how does Westside prepare for all meets? As you know, Westside uses a three-week pendulum wave style periodization from Arosive and others. It was very common for sports teams.\nAll waves consist of 75, 80, and 85 percent at lockout with a combination of barbell weight plus chains, bands, or both. On every fourth week, it is rolled back to 75 percent. Westside uses a delayed transformation of 28 days devised by three renowned coaches: Matveyev, Y. V. Verkhoshansky, and Ivan Abadjiev. These gentlemen’s research made it possible for Westside to reach our highest results on all three lifts on contest day.\nOther sports like track and swimming can benefit from a delayed transformation for important events. Charlie Francis, the renowned sports coach of Ben Johnson, used the same delayed transformation that a top swimming coach used to break world records. For powerlifting it is of the utmost importance to break a squat record at all meets to make it possible to break your total record. The delayed transformation phase lasts 28 days. Twenty-eight days out from meet time, the lifter will use sets with 50 percent barbell weight plus 25 percent band tension. The lifts are limited to 15 lifts, plus 10 speed pulls with 50 percent bar weight plus 30 percent band tension. The special exercises stay the same. Let’s look at two examples: one for an 800-pound squatter and one for a 1,000-pound squat max.\nTo make an 800-pound meet squat you must box squat 500 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension. It is done on seven lifts after a warmup: 315 pounds for two reps, 370 pounds for two reps, 405 pounds for one, 470 pounds for one, and 500 lbs for 1 rep on a parallel box raw or suit down, no wraps.\nFor a 1,000-pound meet squat, the normal procedure would be 405 pounds x 2, 455 pounds x 2, 500 pounds x 1, 560 pounds x 1, and 600 pounds x 1. The band tension would be 440 pounds or 44 percent of 1,000 pounds.\nLet’s look at A.J. Roberts making a 2,855-pound world record total at 308 with a 1,205-pound squat. Plus for the other two lifts it looks like this: At 21 days out, 740 pounds plus 440 pounds band tension for Friday’s squat workout.\nOn Monday, 18 days out, take opener deadlift with plates on 2-inch mats. This reduces leg drive and emphasizes more back function.\nAt 16 days out, opener bench.\nAt 14 days out, 75 percent of 21 day’s max.\nAt 13 days out, normal speed bench workout.\nAt 11 days out, train only special exercises: belt squat, reverse hyper, rows, hamstrings, etc.\nAt 10 days out, floor press to a new max to alert CNS.\nAt 7 days out, light box squats.\nSaturday before meet, do six sets of speed bench down from nine sets.\nMonday train lower back and legs like normal.\nThen rest and focus on weight cut. As you can see our circa-max phase is concurrent with the delayed transformation phase. The weights for circa-max range from 90 to 97 percent. Westside always breaks new records during this phase, but always with some to spare. Remember train optimally. For the high level, do only on new record, as you have the other two lifts to train in the next few days. I hope this gives insight on how we combine our circa-max training in conjunction with our delayed transformation phase. Why not squat to raise your squat? The late, great Bill Starr wrote an article in the early 1970s entitled “If you want a deadlift, don’t deadlift.” His approach to increasing your deadlift was to stop doing regular deadlifts all the time and replace much of the training with special exercises like power cleans, Goodmornings, rack deadlifts, deadlifts while standing on a box, back hyperextensions, and many small special exercises like leg curls, leg raises, and so forth. It is a period of 18 months from mid 1971 to February 1973.\nThis method increased my deadlift from 550 pounds to 670 pounds at 180 body weight. Westside adopted the same approach for the squat. One must squat on a box, and then train the muscles that squat separately. Tony Olievira came to Westside to train fulltime with a 900-pound squat. In three weeks the team competed and Tony made 890 pounds. Just like Bill Starr’s method, Westside does not asses a squat workout in a weekly plan, but rather evaluates the lifter by first watching their technique to determine if they are starting in the right direction, meaning performing correct biomechanical efficiency. Incorrect technique can lead to first pain, then injury. Pain can limit one from producing maximal strength. Pain from bad technique can reduce your neuromuscular efficiency. This can affect the skill one needs to perform a squat. To perfect the kinematic chain, one must display the correct sequence of muscular actions. This means developing the correct coordination patterns of motor skills. Now let’s think. If you have bad form, repeating the same actions will only lead to accommodation, leading to diminishing returns. Tony would not sit back first in the squat movement, but instead go straight down, using the incorrect muscle group, meaning the quadriceps, which can lead to knee injury.\nMore squatting would not correct this. Building the major muscle groups to produce proper technique is the answer. If a boxer would slap you on the right side of your face, after the first time your response would be to block it with your right hand. If the boxer would always try to slap you on the right side of your face, you would develop the muscle action to block it over and over forever. Our theory is likewise, meaning we would build the glutes to push back, while forcing your knees out to the side so the lifter starts the squat by sitting backwards, then down. This is the correct muscular pattern. First we must build a specific sequence for perfecting a perfect movement. Arched back Goodmornings play a great role in the process. To do an arch back Goodmorning, place bar in the squat position. Note not low bar. Now with a shoulder or wider stance, brace your abs against your belt. Next, lean forward with an extreme arch in your entire back.\nNever let your back bend at all. This is a very limited range of motion exercise, letting the bar go in front of the knees slightly, about six to eight inches. Hold bottom position for two or three seconds by super arching your spinal erectors, then complete the rep. Do three to five reps per set, working up to a heavy set, but never let the back lose the arch. To perform while leaning forward, push your glutes out to the rear while pre-stretching the hamstrings. To complete the lift, push against the bar to complete the lift.\nThis is the same biomechanical pattern as the start and finish of the squat. To build the glutes and hips, you can walk in the ATP or do isometric holds. The holds can be for 60 seconds a set, by standing erect while pushing the hips forward and backwards simulating the correct start and finish of a squat or deadlift. A walking set can go up to two minutes a set. This work can be 10 minutes of actual work. This work fluctuates 15 degrees in either the up or down direction. This is a major exercise at Westside for both squatting and deadlifting.\nNext, the hamstrings play a great role in squatting. Westside uses four exercises for the hamstrings. First, we use the inverse leg curl. This is a machine that allows one to do a Russian leg curl first, but reduces some of the athlete’s bodyweight. Take weight off lever arm until lifter is using just body weight.\nThen place lever arm on ground and you are ready to do a Russian leg curl plus added weight. Next, do calf-ham glute raises with weight. Both exercises rep range is two to six reps. Next, do standing leg curls. This exercise really builds the hamstrings around the knee. And last for building strength for muscles, but also connective tissue, do band leg curls. Here hook a band around your power rack while sitting on a bench and hook ankles through band and leg curl your heels under your glutes for a total of 200 reps a day.\nDo sets of 50 or more per set. Also, ankle weight leg curls, again 200 total reps per day, 10 to 20 pounds on each foot. Pick bands or ankle weights, not both on the same day. On our max effort day, the deadlift or heavy Goodmorning also help build your squat by building your entire back. Tony always does speed squats on Friday, totaling 25 lifts with an average weight of 80 percent.\nOn Monday Tony does some type of squat two out of three weeks, almost always with a special bar. A lot with a very low box, or onto soft foam with a close stance, which is the opposite of his very wide stance. This training method produced a meet squat in just under six months to 1,065 pounds. That is a 165-pound increase not by squatting more, but by building his posterior chain. A hint for our Olympic weightlifting brothers: stop squatting four and five times a week and spend more time building your back and hamstrings and don’t forget your glutes. Why do you say track athletes spend too much time running? After one learns correct running technique, you must increase strength and power.\nWhy do men run faster than women? Simply they are stronger and more powerful. Women’s technical skills are on par with their male counterparts, but they lack the strength and power to run as fast or jump as high. Two things happen when running too much. One, you create a speed barrier. Constantly performing the same speed exercises or running the same distance at the same time, you develop a speed barrier. The athlete learns to run at a certain speed and no faster even if they become stronger, more flexible or have a faster reaction time.\nMany coaches believe to become faster, more running must be included, but because of always repeating the same effort, the speed barrier grows.\nNote: read The Science of Sport Training by Thomas Kurz.\nIf the athlete performs the same training load with the same exercises over long periods of time, the sports performance will decrease. Performance comes from a result of adaptation, but the great sprint expert, Dr. Ben Tabachnik, said to adapt to training is to never fully adapt to training.\nNote: much can be found about adaptation in Dr. Atko Viru’s book, Adaptations in Sport Training.\nProgress comes fast in the beginning, but after a few years in the same program, there is often no change in performance improvements.\nWhile advocating weight training, it must be done correctly. Learn to perform exercises correctly with explosive strength being the goal, and not building excessive muscle mass, adding to the athlete’s body weight. This concept works for any distance from 60 meters to running a marathon. Don’t mistake becoming bigger means getting stronger. Remember, big ain’t strong, strong is strong. In Underground Secrets to Faster Running by Barry Ross, Mr. Ross brings up many valid points about faster running. Why should one become stronger and more powerful?\nPeter Weyland’s study found that force, not faster leg movement, produced faster times. It is greater ground force and minimal ground contact. Ninety percent of effort to run is to overcome gravity. This is about your strength level combined with how much you weigh. In Underground Secrets to Faster Running, he discussed a study found in the Journal of Biomechanics in 1987. It showed that amount of force used horizontally during constant speed is only one-tenth the amount of force used vertically. This is why to run faster, you must overcome gravity. The stronger you are pound for pound, the faster you can run. Remember, the greater the mass, the greater the gravitational pull. To run faster, it requires three things: how much muscular force you can deliver during ground contact, ground contact time must be held to as minimal time as possible, and stride rate, meaning how often you contact the ground.\nAnd above all, weight training must be aimed at increasing strength and power, not adding unnecessary mass or body weight. Two methods of weight training are employed: the dynamic method, lifting or throwing a non maximal load with the highest attainable speed. Lifting 30 to 60 percent for developing a fast rate or force. For speed strength, training at 75 to 85 percent of a 1RM. The second method is superior for improving maximal strength.\nThis method uses the most motor units. Maximal speed or a maximal effort is all that should be used to make one more powerful and as strong as possible.\nTo run when the foot strikes the ground, there is a rapid change in both muscle length and the forces developed. This, again, is why strength and power must be emphasized. A study by L Paavolainen in 1999 entitled “Explosive Strength Training Improves 5-km Running Times” supported this idea.\nThe study dropped 32 percent of the running and replaced it with explosive strength training. The weight training increased ground force that decreases ground contact time. The study showed that by decreasing one-hundredth of a second per stride on a 5km race that uses 2,500 strides, an overall reduction of 25 seconds can be made. The more powerful sprinters who produce much greater ground force will have a greater reduction of ground force contact time, meaning a much greater sprinting time. First, however, one must learn correct running mechanics. Second, like the max effort method shows, you must remember that your body responds to the demands placed upon it. For neuromuscular adaptation, one must run at top speed. Try to increase the acceleration phase for as long as possible to limit the maintenance phase. That reduces the deceleration phase to a minimum. There are many fallacies like doing the high knee drills, when in fact this phenomenon creates a rebound effect that causes an increase in elevation due to reversible muscular action during the stretch-shortening cycle. The last and possibly the most important part of all this is injuries. Track has far too many injuries through running too much, causing overuse injuries. When a top male sprinter makes ground contact, it can produce 1,000 pounds of ground force. Multiply this with the average ground strikes of 43 and it adds up to 43,000 pounds of force in roughly 10 seconds. The same athlete will never lift 1,000 pounds on both feet at a time in the weight room.\nBut the coach will repeatedly have their athlete overrun and cause them to reach a speed barrier. Charlie Francis said this can happen as early as 13-years-old. I had an Olympian visit Westside who ran in the 2016 Olympics and he informed me that he ran two times a week and only ran 50, 100, and 150 m, never longer.\nHe worked only on acceleration for his 200 meter race. There is time for weight training all year long. It can be done in 25 minutes for athletes who squat or deadlift 550 pounds or less. After a fast warmup 5x5 sets at 275, 300, 325, plus 25 percent band tension will only take 15 minutes with 1½-minute rest intervals between sets for both squats and deadlifts. This leaves 10 minutes for small special exercises for the most important running muscles. For max effort work, working up to a max, doing only singles, takes very little time. This leaves lots of time for your running training and all important restoration. Louie",

Most think of this work as nine sets of three reps using three different grips. Do three sets with the index finger just touching the smooth part of the bar. Next, move outward for three sets and finally do three sets with the little finger touching the power ring. You can do the grips any way you would like. Most do the closest grips first, but it is up to you how you do the sets.\nWestside started doing the sets with about 40 percent bar weight and 30 percent chain or band for accommodating resistance due to bar deceleration. The light percent was for a rate of force development or RFD. Years ago most powerlifters were not that fast, but with the speed-strength benching we became almost too fast, which led to the great speed, but a reduction in force.\nNow in 2017 Westside has moved up the bar weight to 50 percent plus 30 percent chain or bands. The close and moderately close grips helped build more than just triceps. After the bench sets, two or three sets of dumbbell presses are done. For each workout you should change bench angles from flat, seated, incline, and decline to work the muscles at many angles.\nUse a weight that is fairly easy for 20 reps per set. Next, go to triceps. Westside rotates the exercises when progress can no longer be made—dumbbell rollbacks, elbows out extensions, French press. Westside benches then we train the muscles that bench.

Barbell extensions play a large role in Westside training—EZ-curl bar, football bar, straight bar. The bars are rotated when necessary to raise weights, again 60 to 100 reps is just a guideline, some can do more while it could be too much for others. After the dumbbell or barbell extensions, do 100 push-downs in high reps or band pushdowns for the 100 reps. The triceps are very important and certainly the lockout. Next, it is lats, upper back, and delts. This means front, side, and rear delts.\nThe bars are rotated when necessary to raise weights, again 60 to 100 reps is just a guideline, some can do more while it could be too much for others.

I had always used the advice of Larry Pacifico for benching when it came to triceps, but Bill Seno, a great bencher, and upper body builder, gave me a time-tested program for adding pounds to your bench. Work up to a six rep max starting light so you can keep adding weight for three or four weeks. When no more progress can be made, start over with an\nWhen no more progress can be made, start over with an eight-rep max. After a few weeks and no more progress can be made, go to a 10 rep max. After a few weeks of 10-rep maxing out, go back to a third program. This time it is 6x6 reps for a few weeks until it becomes impossible to go higher. Then start over with 8x8 reps. Again, do eight reps per set until you can go no higher.\nNow it is time to start over with 10 sets of 10 reps. The last two programs are for building bench press muscles with its high volume when doing a six rep max. The next cycle with the 6x6, 8x8, and 10x10 reps is an extra high volume.\nWhen a meet is about 12 weeks out, go back to the original 9x3 reps.\nAll workouts can be done with bands or chains or a combination of both. It is common to add a choked band to increase the lockout. It can be any band from minis, monster, light, medium, or strong. This is a great method for a raw or geared lifter.\nThe reps can be done with any grip—close, medium, wide or ultra-wide, meaning about-one inch outside the illegal lines for a meet. Only do one method per cycle. This is a lot of work but the results speak for themselves. After any of the three speed-day workouts, always do all the special exercises for the triceps, back, and delts. Louie",

How?\nA large part is the max effort workouts. There are too many available for you to use all the max effort workouts, so you must choose what works best for you. Everyone is different biomechanically. This means the length of arms and the dimensions of the chest and shoulders, as well as how flexible your spine is for arching.\nAsk questions such as “Should you raise your head or keep it on the bench?” The max effort method is proven by science, the greatest method for increasing strength. You can learn more in Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. M. Zatsiorsky. George Halbert said there are builders and testers. This means use some special workouts to raise your strength and others to test your strength. For me, it was the JM press, steep incline, close grip. These were my testers as to how much I could bench. Tricep extensions, heavy pushups, and upper back work were the builders. This is something you must learn on your own. Here is a list of max effort workouts to rotate: Board press (close or wide grip) The Culver City Westside used board or rubber mats in the 1960s and it works today just as it did back then. Jesse Kellum advised me to start using boards again in the early 1990s. It works for building a raw bench and helped Pat Casey make the first 600 pound around 1970. It helped our Doug Heath break the\nIt helped our Doug Heath break the 400 pound barrier at 132 pounds to become Westside’s first world record bencher. Westside Columbus, Ohio, originally started with one through three. But George Halbert found the tool to detect your tricep strength: a four and five board. It would isolate the triceps due to the force posture relationship.\nAt the top of the lift, the triceps must do most of the work. For a test, many could not do as much weight on four boards as they could on three boards. For many, without a heave, even weight could be locked out on five boards. Boards served mostly as testers. Rack press (close or wide grip) Rack presses are somewhat like board presses, but you can not heave the weight. Nobody action here as only arms, back, and shoulders are primarily doing all of the work. Basically, three positions are used: at chest, at midpoint, and at lockout. One can press off pins concentrically or lower the bar to a pin, pause, and then press to completion. Do not bounce off the pin, always pause before pressing. Chain press (close or wide grip) Westside made chain and band pressing commonplace in the world of strength training. Chain and band pressing are referred to as combinations of resistance methods. More can be found in Supertraining on page 409.\nFor chain pressing, it requires first a light set of chains ¼-inch around five feet long. It is connected to the bar sleeve and set at a position to run ⅝-inch or ¾-inch chain through, looking like an upside down horseshoe. Approximately one-third of both ends of the chain will rest on the floor before unracking the barbell. Pile chain upon chain when adding\nApproximately one-third of both ends of the chain will rest on the floor before unracking the barbell. Pile chain upon chain when adding chain for resistance. One chain up to five sets is used. Up to three sets of chains are used for speed work, while four or five sets are used for max-effort. This is around 200 pounds of chain at lockout. Band press (close or wide grip) For more information, see Supertraining page 409. Bands are very precise for tension when attaching them the same way. Westside hooks its bands around four by fours when benching.\nYou can use a set of mini bands at 85 pounds at lockout. Monsters are 125 pounds. Light bands when doubled around the barbell are 200 pounds for the very strong; 600 pounds raw and up. Chains plus bands (close or wide grip) Westside uses combinations of chains and bands. To perform with chain weight, choke the band to release tension at the bottom of the bench, but as you lockout the bands now engage tension. This system calls for many combinations with different amounts of chains, plus using different strengths of bands, for example mini-monster-light bands. The same system can be used with bands. For example, bench with monsters and choke a light band for extra lockout work. Incline/decline (close or wide grip) When benching, one moves in different angles. Years ago many powerlifters trained on mild inclines and declines and seldom used a flat bench—Doug Heath and Gary Drago, two powerlifters, for example. Westside uses both for its bench training. Close and wide grip are used along with at least two settings on the incline or decline. Dumbbell training If you want a strong bench, you must use dumbbells in your training. Dumbbells are always used after speed benching for two or three and sometimes four sets with a moderate weight for sets of 15 to 20 reps. This advice came from the former East German field events training for throwing.\nAll four angles were exercised: flat, incline, decline, and seated. I have never known a super strong bencher who did not use dumbbells. For max effort day, about every three or four weeks, do an extreme dumbbell workout. One of Westside’s favorites is one weight after a warmup for three sets for a single set or a three set rep record.\nMy weights were 155 pounds, 125 pounds, and 100 pounds. My records were 155 for 13 to 11 and nine reps; 125 for 23 to 21 and 19 reps. Fred Bolt made 34 with 100 pounds at 185 bodyweight. Compared to the big bencher at Westside, these numbers were very meager. Use decline, incline, flat, and seated. Dumbbell presses can be done with one arm at a time or alternating arms.\nAfter one style for max weight and reps, choose a second angle and go all out again. When doing high rep, heavy weight dumbbells you must take much longer rest intervals. I would have to take up to six minutes in between sets. a. Bar dips Other substitutes are bar dips with and without weight around the waist. Depending on how you hold your body position is how it works the body. Be careful of the distance between you and the bar as it is easy to hurt yourself. Place a box under your feet and do heavy dip lockouts. George Halbert and Kenny Patterson used dip lockouts and both raw benched 625 pounds. b. Bar push ups (close and wide grip) Do pushups while gripping a bar lying in the bottom of a power rack, feet on the floor or elevated. After using just bodyweight, have someone place a plate on the upper back and do sets of reps or try all time records. When a 100-pound plate is not hard, have a training partner sit on your shoulders facing forwards while holding onto the power rack for balance. Keep feet held straight out in front.\nIf you are lucky, like at Westside, the person sitting on your shoulders can range from 120 pounds and up. This was one of my favorite exercises for the bench. With my feet on the floor with the bar six inches off the floor, I made 58 repetitions with 100 pounds on my back, to bench 515 pounds raw at 208 bodyweight. My training partner Garry Sanger at 202 bodyweight made 53 reps with a 500 pound raw bench. Larry Pacifico would do handstand push ups for his world record benching. Floor press (close or wide grip) This is a test of our bench when the arms are on the floor. It is everyone’s sticking point regardless of arm length. The floor press is done 10 days out of the contest. If we break our records, we break our records in the meet. For training you can use chains or bands. Also, floor press off the power rack pins for more variety.\nWestside is always introducing new ways to train, but this covers most of the bench training. The only way to know how Westside trains is to train at Westside. We have many visitors that come from all over the world. Anyone can visit Westside by just calling or emailing to make sure we are training or to see if we are out of town at a meet.\nGood Luck,\nLouie",

First, you must build your speed strength and second, in the same time frame, you must raise your absolute strength. A shot putter must become stronger and at the same time, faster. The majority of this training is combining max effort exercises to increase the strength potential of the muscles, while training with light weights will lead to improving speed.\nTo improve explosive strength, the movement must change from eccentric to a concentric action. One popular method is the Plyometrics method. For this, depth jumps are in order. This calls for the athlete to fall from a distance and upon landing, immediately jump upward in under 0.2 seconds. This is reversible muscular action or the stretch-shortening cycle. It is used in most sports skills due to muscle and tendon elasticity. The athlete must use the correct movement velocities.\nMaximum force (Fmm) is developed in slow velocity while building maximum velocity the resistance must be small. Now how do you build explosive strength in your training in a weekly, monthly, yearly, and multi-year training? By two proven methods: One is the max effort method and the other is the contrast method. If your task is to jump onto a 60-inch box, you must be strong to overcome your bodyweight to achieve the effort needed to jump that height. The formula is known as moment impulse. The max effort men such as Yuri Verkhoshansky and A. Bondarchuk would employ a heavy-light system. This system calls for a 90 percent plus weight to be lifted, pulled, or pushed isometrically, then immediately you lift a load of 30 to 40 percent. The heavyweights are for maximum strength before lifting a light load. This is the contrast method.\nBut how does Westside train? One workout for the lower body is performed Monday for max effort. Each week the barbell exercise is rotated from a pull or a squat and also a Goodmorning. Keep records on each max effort lift and try to exceed the old records. This is max effort. There is no two to three or five rep max effort. The low reps are submaximal effort according to Naglak (1979). Maximal effort method is superior to all strength methods for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordination.\nThis method makes it possible to bring forth the largest strength gains. The body adapts to the specific demands placed upon it. This causes the most muscle units (MU) to be activated, according to V. M. Zatsiorsky.\nPick seven special large barbell exercises to rotate each week. Here are some examples:\nLow box squat\nHigh box squat\nFront squat—use wide or close stance\nRack pull\nBox pull\nPower clean\nPower snatch\nArched-back Goodmorning\nBent-back Goodmorning\nAlso, have records with at least three different band tensions.\nThe barbell volume is low on max effort day, but as you will learn, the small special exercises make up 80 percent of the training load on both days, working on a single muscle group at one time. The athlete who is strongest at the same body weight will jump higher or longer if both have the same athleticism.\nNow that we are improving your maximal strength, your speed strength must be improved. There will be an interaction between all special strengths: maximum, speed-strength, and explosive strength. All three have their specific roles in sports movements. Speed strength is trained at intermediate velocities, 0.8 m/s. This strength must be trained to ensure the development of producing speed against resistance. Like Olympic weightlifting, Westside trains at 75 to 85 percent for speed strength, while max-effort training for a new all-time record calls for three lifts per workout. Example: 500-pound max deadlift would look like this: 450 or 90 percent, 485 or 97 percent, then 505 or 510 for a new record. That is three lifts per week or 12 per month while speed strength training calls for 25 squats and 20 pulls a week or 100 squats and 80 pulls a month for the development of speed strength. Two special strengths cannot be trained with only one amount of resistance, due to each having its own force-velocity curve. Let’s remember motion velocity decreases as external resistance increases and maximum velocity (Vmm) is attained when external resistance is close to zero. Westside uses a three-week pendulum wave at 50, 55, and 60 percent, plus 25 percent band tension at lockout. Example: 400-pound max lift\nWeek 1: 200 lb, 100 lb band tension, 5 sets of 5 reps\nWeek 2: 220 lb, 100 lb band tension, 5 sets of 5 reps\nWeek 3: 240 lb, 100 lb band tension, 5 sets of 5 reps\nWeek 4: 200 lb, 100 lb band tension, 5 sets of 5 reps This wave system is continuous throughout the yearly plan. The percentage as best used for speed strength. The speed strength training is lighter than max effort weights, causing the bar speed to be a greater velocity. As one throws a heavier object, the velocity and the distance will decrease.\nNow explosive strength is trained at the fastest velocity of all or high velocity due to less total resistance. The use of rubber bands for accommodating resistance is a must for compensatory acceleration training, known as CAT training. This means you must accelerate through the entire range of motion, which is impossible without attaching rubber bands to the barbell due to your posture strength curves. Look for yourself on page 40 in The Science and Practice of Strength Training (Zatsiorsky, Kraemer, 2006). Remember there are two methods to break a sticking point. One is to train at or near your sticking point; the other is to develop more speed to go through it. For training explosive strength, interchange speed strength training three-week cycles, for a three-week explosive strength cycle, using a combined 30 to 40 percent. The bar speed must be above 1 m/s. You must know that bands have two advantages. One is a faster overspeed eccentric phase that produces greater kinetic energy, producing a stronger rate of reversible muscular action. This is due to muscle and tendon elasticity causing a greater strength-shortening cycle.\nThe weight or resistance must be less than speed strength training due to higher bar velocity. The combinations of resistance methods is used for explosive strength training. A combination of barbell weight and band tension produces the greatest results. Roughly a 50 percent bar weight and 50 percent band weight works very well. For training a fast rate of force development, the experts suggest not to exceed 60 to 70 percent. As you can see, as the percent of a 1RM is lowered, the training velocity increases. Westside alternates a three-week speed strength cycle with an explosive strength cycle. Example: 300-pound max squat\nWeek 1: 60 lb bar weight, 70 lb band tension, 6x6, total = 130\nWeek 2: 70 lb bar weight, 70 lb band tension, 6x6, total = 140\nWeek 3: 80 lb bar weight, 70 lb band tension, 6x6, total = 150 The bar speed must exceed 1.2 m/s. Yuri Verkhoshansky used 40 percent for most of his explosive strength training, but on occasions, up to 60 percent was used. The goal with this cycle is to raise maximal power development. Thirty-six lifts are optimal for power development. Do no less than 24 and no more than 48 lifts per workout.\nWhen using the complex method—meaning lifting a heavyweight then immediately going to a 30 to 60 percent weight—a much greater method is to use a large amount of band tension. Because of bands losing some tension at the bottom, it makes it possible to move a near maximal weight at lockout, but also makes one capable of starting the weight from the bottom position. This is not possible with just barbell weight, as it would be much heavier in the bottom position. A combination of weight and bands can make it possible to have the perfect weight on the top and bottom position. The athlete will learn to outrun the band tension, contributing to acceleration and power development.\nWe have covered weight training by not only 1RM but also by velocity. But is there something faster? Yes. Jumping and bounding and depth jumps. For performing depth jumps, the drop height for most should be 12 to18 or 24 inches. For the very strong and highly advanced, use a 36-inch box. Upon landing, jump as high as possible. Note: please learn how to perform depth jumps correctly by reading Special Strength Training Manual for Coaches by Yuri Verkhoshansky and Natalia Verkhoshansky (2011). Jumping causes the fastest velocity of all. Explosive strength is the ability to rapidly increase force (Tidow, 1990). The steeper the increase of strength in time, the greater the explosive strength. To excel at jumping, you must possess strength-speed elasticity, the correct body type and weight. Always measure your jumps for length or height and number. Westside performs 40 jumps twice a week with resistance. Jumping from the kneeling position builds a strong foundation for all jumping or bounding exercises. Ankle weights, weight vest, Kettlebells and barbell jumps must be rotated continuously for best results to prevent accommodation. Keep records for all jumps with a standing, running, or seated approach.\nWestside’s guidelines for jumping come from 35 years of experiments with the strongest men and women in the sport of powerlifting, along with top track athletes including two gold medal sprinters.\nYou must train at the correct velocity to build a special strength. One can become stronger and jump higher in the beginning of training, but progress will stop if the rate of force development does not improve. There are many things to consider for improving sports performance. Louie",

Westside Barbell, founded by world-renowned strength and powerlifting coach, trainer and author Louie Simmons, is more than a gym; it’s an honored hall filled with a select group of premier-level athletes who strive to push the very limits of their minds and bodies. An invitation-only training laboratory, the dedication of Louie and all generations of athletes, have created a lineage of powerlifters, champions, and even Olympians that few gyms could ever hope to match In fact, the legends that have walked through our chalky doors have worked diligently to be the very best at what they do; feats that have broken more than 140 world records, brought home Olympic gold, and claimed world heavyweight championships.\nLouie takes pride in the fact that Westside Barbell is far more than a gym. It’s a home built upon hard work, blood, sweat, and other peoples’ tears. It’s not for the weak; it’s not for the timid; and it’s not for those seeking fame.\nIt is, however, the place where powerlifters, athletes, and those who want the very best out of their bodies by educating themselves on highly-researched training and sound, practical application. In other words, those who value consistency, intelligence, and more than a little effort. At Westside Barbell, you’ll find greatness in our methods and our athletes because we believe in more than just “lining up and lifting heavy.” We study, analyze, educate, and train athletes based on more than 30 years of real, firsthand experience.There are limitless accolades to be found within Westside Barbell, if that’s what you’re looking to find. You’ll see that we have 30 athletes who deadlift more than 800 lbs. We’re also the only gym in the world with two athletes over 2700-lb. total lifting records and one with the biggest total of all time with 3,010 lbs. Louie has even had the immense opportunity to act as a strength consultant for numerous NFL and college football teams, train two Olympic gold-medal sprinters, and work side-by-side with the top professional strength coaches worldwide. And while these are all great experiences and boast-worthy achievements, nothing is more important and more worthwhile than mentoring and training athletes, helping them achieve their goals, and staying true to relentless hard work. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Exercises that did not improve the field events were not used during the competition period. His selection was based on the three main training periods: accumulation, intensification, and transformation.\nWhile Westside only utilizes the three-period system one time, it lasts about 10 months for a new, but advanced lifter or athlete. First, it does no good to be strong in the wrong exercises. When I competed, 80 percent of the training consisted of special exercises, 20 percent squat, bench press and deadlift. Westside’s theory of training is to first box squat then train the muscles individually. To raise my squat to a new standard, I would increase my reverse hyper volume by adding extra reps and adding more weight.\nFor the inverse leg curls, I would remove weight off the device until I was doing actual Russian leg curls while holding weight.\nAt the same period, I would add weight to my calf-ham-glute raises. Also, I would add standing leg curls and regular leg curls with as much weight as possible. I was always trying to exceed the volume and intensity from my last meet.\nBack raises were also pushed going into a meet. I would use as much weight as possible breaking new barriers with the amount of weight used, as well as pushing Goodmornings. I was always working up in shrug weights along with heavier abs. And last but not least, I was constantly adding weight to my power sled walks, going from six to 10 trips of 60 yards. This covers the box squat and deadlift training.\nFor the Bench\nI always pushed for new records in the J.M. press. I did one on a four-inch piece of carpet and one in the power rack two inches below chest level by using a cambered bench bar. Next, I worked on breaking new records on tricep extensions with dumbbell rollbacks and elbows out to the side. My last indicator was a very steep incline press with hands touching the smooth part of the bar. When I broke records in these special exercises, I broke a record in the meet. It made no sense to stop doing exercises that made me the strongest at meet time where I had to perform my best. This made it possible to make top ten benches from 1980-2002, top ten squat from 1971-2000, and top ten deadlifts from 1972-2005 at 57-years-old.\nBut what about other sports such as track?\nI have worked with several top sprinters. Their coaches make at least two critical mistakes. One, after doing weight training they stop weight training, losing their strength base doing only running and it almost always leads to an injured athlete. If weight training is at all important, why stop it? It is much better to cut back on some running and maintain correct weight training. Some experts suggest reducing running by 35 percent. When this was done, speed increased and injuries decreased.\nThe definition of a sprint is to run as fast as possible for a short distance. Explosive weight training is a good transfer of exercise. Running a mile is not a good example of a transfer of exercise. A mile run is not building a base for a sprinter. It is only a base for running a mile. A sprint is two things, for top sprinters acceleration and hopefully maintaining top running speed.\nA sprinter-specific muscle type is not conducive to running long distance due to the fact that they not only cannot maintain top speed but suffer from constant deceleration. This is not sport specific for a sprinter. Remember a sprint must always improve strength and power. A top male sprinter produces up to 1,000 pounds per step while sprinting. Most cover 100 meters in 43 to 45 steps. That’s 43,000 to 45,000 pounds in 10 seconds. No sprinter can lift 1,000 pounds in a squat, let alone on one foot. They must maintain a large base to prevent injury.\nThere are far too many injuries from track. This falls directly on the coach. Too much sport-specific work leads to a speed barrier. This is not a good example of what Bondarchuk was thinking when he wrote Transfer of Training in Sports (2007).\nWhat is a good example of transfer of exercises for a 100-meter or 200-meter sprinter?\nFor a 100-meter sprint, keep records for 30, 50, and 60 meters. This should be a test for their acceleration. After 30 meters could also be tested to gauge progress. Box jumps are very important. If you can jump on a higher box at the same or heavier body weight, you are more powerful.\nStanding long jump and standing triple jump should also be tested. For a 200-meter sprinter\nA Jamaican 200-meter Olympic sprinter who ran in the 2016 Olympics told me he ran twice a week and concentrated on sprinting 50, 100 and 150 meters for acceleration for time. He did a lot of sled work in grass also for time. Plus he did jumps—single and multi-jumps. For both the 100 and 200 meter, the sprinter increased the maximal strength and a lot of light weights 30 to 40 percent for increasing explosive strength. After perfecting technique one must improve their strength and power. The Jamaican team uses our inverse curl for hamstrings and a bent pendulum reverse hyper for low back plus hamstring and glute isolation. They use the ATP for all matter of strength training, from jumping, running in place, step-ups, and static poses in the correct leg angles for sprinting. This is a proper example of a correct transfer of exercise.\nLouie",

The small special exercises are for hypertrophy. Westside has 4 large workouts a week and 4 small workouts for recovery or building one or two muscle groups.\nWhen experts say G.P.P. workouts are not needed for advanced athletes, westside has found just the opposite. We found that not doing the small G.P.P. workouts, we suffer from detraining. Any athlete will regress in strength, endurance, or speed when G.P.P. for hypertrophy is neglected and injury occur. Westside sees this in track and football constantly.\nThe Bulgarian weightlifting system called for only M-E workouts and did no G.P.P. workouts. That felt so extreme, training just recovery methods were used. Whereas Westside system calls for small hypertrophy for recovery, as well as other physical recovery methods.\nVolume is the key to high standards in all sports. Here Westside relies on the small workouts to add volume in a certain muscle group. Most systems call for a reduction of one phase of training while emphasizing another.\nBut for 35 years Westside has found a way to cover all aspects of physical training in a weekly plan. Two M-E days, two days for explosive power or strength, plus at least 4 small workouts for strength, or power or speed. Whatever is lacking you must train. That leads to a spot-specific fitness or building strength in a lacking muscle group.\nG.P.P. for strength on the second workout do single joint movements to increase strength. Upper Body Triceps extension up to 100 reps\nDelt raise for front, side, and rear\nPeck flys\nTrap work, shrugs, upright rows\nLats, rows of all kinds, pulldown, pull-ups\nHammer curls, reverse curls\nPushups Lower Body G.P.P. Reverse hyper\nBack raise\nCalf ham glute raise\nInverse curls, laying and standing leg curl\nCalf work standing and seated\nAbs of all kind, situps, leg raise, side bends\nWork in A.T.P. belt squat machine, belt squatting, static holds walking in machine The exercises are for strength in one area of the body. The workout should not exceed 45 min. Train your weakest muscle group. It does no good to be strong in the wrong exercises. G.P.P for fitness and general endurance. For strength and power do 60m walks sled work of all types for upper and lower. For great endurance walk up to 2 or more miles. You can add ankle weight or a weight vest. Wheel Barrow High weight for no more than 60m for strength. Rotate amount of weight, walk or run. It not only builds strength but balance. For great endurance walk or run up to ½ mile with light loads rotate weight. Sometimes pull weight sled from behind while using wheelbarrow. You can also add ankle weight or weight vests. Belt Barrow Walking forward or backward for 60m for raising strength. Longer distance up to 400m for strength endurance. This device is very grueling but you can add ankle weights or weight vest.\nWestside believes in building strength and fitness simultaneously to utilize the athletes’ time more efficiently. Circuit Training Circuit training has been used for over 60 years. The system is practiced to combine several aspects of fitness at the same time. This builds all-around fitness. It is a collection of 6 to 10 stations or exercises to perform a set of reps or a prescribed time limit, then go to the next station and do the required work and move to the next station until a full circuit is completed. For more advanced, do more than one circuit depending on your fitness level.\nDo not do the same sequence or rest intervals repeatedly for best results. A station can be a weight machine or a barbell or a dumbbell. Even pushups or situps, jumping rope, throwing a med ball or bodyweight drills with a partner.\nAs you can see G.P.P. can be several aspects of training either for fitness or strength, as well as mobility or flexibility.\nDo circuits in water or land or sand to change its impact on the body, such as a reduction in body fat. Look at what your goals are and choose wisely. G.P.P can also reduce soft tissue injuries that cause set back in your training. If you want to stay on the court, field, or platform then you must include G.P.P. in your yearly plan.

The maximal strength of a muscle or a group of muscles in a given movement equals the highest external resistance an athlete can overcome or hold with full voluntary mobilization of his or her neuromuscular system according to Platonov (1997) and Tidow (1990). This definition also is found in Science of Sports Training by Thomas Kurz (2016).\nThere are four methods to test maximal strength: eccentric, concentric, isometric and electro stimulation. When testing your maximal strength, it is described as the Maximal Effort Method, which is the most effective method for increasing both intramuscular and inter muscular coordination. The M-E Method is also recommended when you are attempting to become as strong as possible. This means lifting a one rep max (1RM). Get Special Strengths For All Sports Today! Your variants will appear here Buy Now There are four methods to test maximal strength: eccentric, concentric, isometric and electro stimulation. When testing your maximal strength, it is described as the Maximal Effort Method, which is the most effective method for increasing both intramuscular and inter muscular coordination. The M-E Method is also recommended when you are attempting to become as strong as possible. This means lifting a one rep max (1RM). Doing two or three reps builds strength endurance or submaximal resistance. Siff and Verkhoshansky (1999) and Zatsiorsky (1995) in their respective studies said doing four to seven reps builds heavy resistance; moderately heavy permits eight to 12 reps; moderate resistance permits 13 to 18 reps; light resistance allows 19 to 25 reps, and very light permits more than 25 reps. As you become stronger, explosive strength that is displayed in fast velocity and speed strength in intermediate velocity will be improved when combined with the Dynamic Method—training 72 hours later for both upper and lower body exercises. Many coaches are fearful of M-E training. If you are familiar with the actions of the Golgi tendon receptors, then you will know that they are very sensitive to the forces developed in the muscle. If the tension in the muscle rises too fast, the Golgi tendon reflex evokes the inhibition of muscle action. This simply means a body will stop producing higher muscular forces to protect itself. The same type of protective action does not happen during football when two athletes are tackling one another. This means M-E Method is far safer than contact football. Most injuries happen when the muscles around the joint are not strong due to insufficient weight training. How to Use the M-E Method If you are not sure of yourself to practice M-E training with both eccentric and concentric actions combined or singular, simply use isometric training. Isometric training can be employed by pulling, pressing or squatting against a bar loaded to a weight the athlete cannot overcome and exert force from 80 percent to maximal for two to four seconds for a few sets at three or four positions. The maximal strength gain is the position where the force is exerted, but it can radiate up and down 15 degrees as well. Isometrics are broken into two types: concentric ad eccentric actions. A concentric isometric action happens when you push or pull on an immovable object. To perform an eccentric isometric action, the athlete must hold a heavy weight in a fixed position. Other M-E Methods: Electro Stimulation In studies by the Russians using electro stimulation to a given muscle or muscle group, they found it can deliver effective training stimulus due to the fact that the electro stimulation can produce a stronger contraction than the athlete can produce on his or her own. This is sometimes referred to as Russian Stim. This method of strength training has been implemented in many sports including weight lifting, track and field, boxing and even rowing. The effects of electro stimulation depend on the types and frequency of use as well as the type of muscle fibers—fast or slow—you are imposing on. Westside has used electro stimulation since the 1990s. Westside used the same method that Dr. Siff used on the Belgian SHW weight lifter Surge Reding. After weight training, he used 0.5 to two seconds with very high-intensity contractions with 10- to 15-second rest intervals. This was done for five minutes for each muscle group. More on this subject can be found in Supertraining (2009). M-E Method with Resistance There have been several studies done while lowering or eccentric over loading. It is done by lowering a barbell with from 10 percent to 60 percent more weight than the lifter can overcome concentrically in a slow as possible motion to build eccentric strength. Westside has never seen a study that contributed to concentric strength by doing maximal eccentric loading. In the real world, eccentrics does two things: 1) It makes the athlete sore as eccentrics tear down muscle fiber, and 2) Body builders will lower their weight slowly as it increases muscle size. (Special note: Westside has made superior strength gains by implementing over speed eccentrics by attaching strong rubber bands over the bar.) M-E Concentric Method The deadlift can be an M-E with maximal loads due to lifting the barbell off the floor first. Special Concentric Methods From a low position squat, press or pull from a power rack off pins. Goodmorning, squat or press-off suspended chains at several heights. Lifting weights from the bottom without an eccentric phase eliminates reversible muscle action. Three out of the five classical lifts start concentrically—clean, snatch, and deadlift—while the squat and bench press start with an eccentric action. M-E Method and Planning Westside’s system calls for an M-E day for benching on Wednesday and squat and deadlift on Monday. Westside makes new records more than 90 percent of the time for the entire workout. At each workout a different M-E lift is switched each week. The reason for this is that if you lift at 90 percent of a 1RM for a three-week wave, you would have diminishing returns. This is proven by science. It’s called the Law of Accommodation. Pick a series of M-E lifts and switch each Wednesday. According to the force velocity curve, strength is measured in the time it takes to complete the lift, not in the amount of weight or the resistance on the bar. For an M-E system, Westside recommends that you drastically change the amount of weight on the M-E barbell exercise. Here are two examples for the squat or deadlift: 1) One week you should squat off a very low bar, close stance with no gear or belt. The author made a 535 and a 555 on a low box (12-inch) with a modified safety squat bar for two all-time records. At the meet it allowed a 900-pound and a 920-pound squat, the second best on the Top 10 list. 2) By pulling a box deadlift of 570-pounds with a five chambered bar that has the bar four inches below floor level the author pulled 716 at 220-pounds eight months after breaking his L-5 vertebrate. How is this possible you might ask? Both the low-box squat and the four-inch deficit deadlift required a longer time period than the contest lifts, and because the extra range of motion is greater than the contest lifts, motion velocity decreases due to the fact that the force-posture relationship is much more difficult because of the greater range of motion. For the competitive lifts, you have one all-time best. But if you only max out on the competitive lifts, you will find it impossible to break your record due to the Law of Accommodation. To solve the dilemma you must devise special exercises to solve the problem of accommodation. Westside has 26 men over 800 pounds and four 900-pound deadlifts, yet we do not do regular deadlifts, meaning deadlifts off the floor. The contest lift is the ultimate test; the special exercises are the builders. Westside will use three positions in the power rack to work up to and break a new record. Westside also uses three different band tensions: mini, monster and light-band-quaded. Thee rates are 170, 250 and 350 at lock. This gives the lifter nine records to break. The deadlifts on the floor are always with accommodating resistance with tensions of 220 with minis and 280 with monsters. The plates sit on the floor, or on two-inch mats or four-inch mats. A second method is to stand on two-inch or four-inch mats using either or both sumo or conventional style for an all-time record. Other methods are ultra-wide sumo and ultra-wide sumo with straight legs and an arched back with a slow start. For overloading the low back and to build technique, you should deadlift while sitting on a box with the starting angle at the same level of the hips you start the deadlift from. Westside breaks records on the special barbell exercise at over a 90 percent rate. All the pulls must take at least the same amount of time to complete as a contest lift. The top lift should be from about the seventh attempt. This would be optional according to Prilepin's data (1974). The M-E squatting is also on Monday. But, remember, max out on only one barbell exercise. It can be a box squat with one of many specialty bars, 14-inch chamber, bow bar, safety squat bar, or front squat. Choose a different bar each week. Most bars will yield approximately the same weight. By using 80 pounds to 300 pounds of chain, work up to a new all-time record on a pre-determined height. For more eccentric over speed, use bands. Seventy to 700 pounds are used at Westside plus bar weight. Here’s an example: AJ made a strength speed squat with 700 pounds of band tension plus 510 pounds of barbell weight. His record was 1,210 pounds at lockout off box. AJ also made 740-pound bar weight and 440-pound band tension, which equated to 1,180 pounds at top. At contest time AJ made a 1,205-pound meet squat. The special squat off a box took as long as or longer than the contest squat. This was much like the training experience the author had with the low-box squat to achieve his contest best by constantly rotating special exercises or combinations of resistance. Westside suggests you choose a special exercise like the low box close stance with no gear where total weight is 555 pounds. Or you might try a rack pull on pins in the Westside Power where the record is 765 pounds. This is a large contrast—over 200 pounds—and switches from a special squat to a special deadlift. This is a very different exercise and completely vanquishes the possibility of accommodation. Remember, strength is measured in velocity or the time it takes to complete the movement. This is very important as you must expect great force for at least the same time as it takes to make a contest lift. After experimenting with several special exercises, simply eliminate the exercises that do not contribute to raising your contest lifts and rotate five or six special exercises each week while constantly breaking your all-time record on a weekly pace. This is how Westside breaks new records each and every week throughout the yearly plan, while others will maybe break a record or two close to their contest. It is very important to make some changes with the exercises, range of motion, or change the band or chain resistance. Normally for each movement there are angular positions at which the maximal values of the Fmm can be reached. But by attaching chain and/or bands, this angular position can be altered to change the sticking points of the lift. You can do it by using bands, which will provide greater reversible muscular actions and provide a great concentric action to overcome a sticking point. Remember, the heaviest weight that is lifted through a full range of joint motion cannot be greater than the strength at the weakest point. But adding more acceleration can break that so-called sticking point. Think about this: Why can the athlete bench 300 to 400 pounds, but cannot complete the lift with 425 pounds? The barbell moved too slowly to make it past the mini-max or sticking point. By attaching a large number of bands it will also build a very strong start. The Central Nervous System (CNS) will comprehend the need to exert more force on the bar to complete the lockout as it recognizes the entire load comprising of barbell weight and accommodating resistance is much heavier at lockout. To summarize, max out on special exercises that are more difficult than the classical lifts. If you miss a classical lift in training it can be very damaging to the athlete psychologically. But if you fail to complete a special barbell exercises, it is just a lift. To finalize, the M-E workout must be 72 hours from the high barbell volume Dynamic workout. The barbell exercise should be rotated each week. After experimenting for six to eight months you will find the mostly less than 10 special barbell exercises that work best for you. Eighty percent of the total volume should be made up of small special exercise. The List of Exercises Box squats Add bands\nRack pulls Add chains\nBox pulls Change stance\nGoodmornings Change bar\nIsometrics Concentric max Bench Press Exercises Pin Presses Standing press\nBoard Press Concentric max\nFloor Press Bands\nIncline Chains\nDecline Isometric There are countless combinations to choose from. Remember, do the ones that work, not just the ones you like. If someone asks where your sticking point is in the bench, squat or deadlift, everyone has an answer. But sticking points should change from time to time by correcting or changing your mini max. A mini max occurs where external resistance is maximal at the point where muscular strength is minimal. This can be altered by accommodation and limiting the time the barbell is at the mini max. This is why lighter weight is not affected at mini max due to greater bar velocity.\nLouis Simmons References Kurtz, Thomas, Science of Sports Training, 2001\nSiff, Dr. Mel, Supertraining, 2003\nSimmons, Louie, Special Strength Development for All Sports, 2015\nZatsiorsky, V.

It is fair to say our outlook was never mainstream from the beginning, but we knew there were huge flaws in what was considered the “norm” for athletic assessment and training.\nThe trajectory of pro sports injury rates and costs prove this belief as they are high, very high and continue to trend in the wrong direction. In 2017 the NFL had 551 on injury reserve costing around $347,144,782. In 2017 NBA 348 players injured costing $599,565,632, (Spotrac, 2017). These numbers do not include the money expended to “fix” or “rehab” said injuries; nor account for the lost production for both the organization and the playing career of the athlete. We have sadly witnessed this firsthand with professional athletes that we work with, and usually, we were saddled with the uphill task of restoring capacity after the injury has occurred. Time after time severe breakdowns in communication feedback loops, or complete lack of, has led to multiple athletic injuries. The more accomplished the athlete, the worse the communication breakdown.\nWhy has our approach been hugely successful when the standard norm is obviously not? How are we taking injured athletes, avoiding surgeries, and developing their capacities to a higher level not even obtained in their “peak” condition?\nIt took a while to properly articulate the uniqueness of our process. It was not new technology, it was not a new training system, and it was not just repeated luck. It was an all-encompassing thought process that at its root had a defined objective;\n‘Skill acquisition is NOT our business; CULTIVATING PHYSICAL CAPACITIES that enable the individual to acquire their skill is our business.’\nThe thought process was evoked by cross referencing from authors that are experts in their fields. Thankfully, we were able to shelf our egos and bias in order to learn from those who have spent the time in the trenches of research and practical application. At the very least we were smart enough to heed to their advice and avoid repeated mistakes.\nOver the next few months we will be exploring each area in great detail from three points of view. One from an internal capacity (Therapist), one from an external capacity (Strength Coach), and finally an article illustrating how internal and external capacities work together. The following content is aimed to generate a conversation about your current thought process. Embracing Chaos As strength coaches, we must alter our perception of the sports our athletes play and in turn the way we prepare them for its demands. Embracing and understanding the fundamentals of chaos theory is the key to unlocking optimal physical capacity.\n(Connolly, 2017) states that an optimally trained athlete has a significantly higher reserve of physical and mental capacity to deal with the unknown random actions of a game (Chaos) in comparison to a suboptimal trained athlete.\nWhy is this? A subpar trained athlete has to wastefully expend energy on the tasks we know exist (Order).\nIt is our job to train the athletes capacity to walk the line between order and chaos (Optimal Training) or in other words to physically prepare an athlete to be the best when they find themselves in the most chaotic situation possible. This third dimension of optimal training is referred to as consciousness (Peterson, 2017) (Gleick, 1988) writes in great detail about the butterfly effect in which something that may seem so small (Micro) and insignificant can ultimately lead to a substantial sequential effect (Macro) later on. When you remove the comfy roses tinted glasses of linear thought you begin to see the beauty of chaos and its hierarchy. This is the itch, the question, the unknown thought at the back of your head but you could just never put your finger on it. Understanding chaos is a leap forward in truly mastering physical training systems. Avoid the Groove It is a trap to think you can fix nonlinear problems with linear solutions. The above is one of the many reasons linear periodization is a sub-par choice for any coach. A reductive training approach will work for an uncomplicated task, but, as we are aware playing professional sports at a high level requires a high competency in executing complex tasks efficiently. The first encounter of the term Groove training came from Dan Di Pasqua of the Melbourne Storm. Dan is one the brightest minds in professional strength coaching and has a wealth of experience that would behoove one to study from.\nLinear systems can only yield linear (Grooved) results. Once an athlete trains into a groove state any stress occurred outside this safety zone increases the risk of injury, and its degree, tremendously due to lack of physical capacity. So how do you increase capacity?\nWell, that leads to the most hotly debated question between sports science, strength coaches, and the highly decorated social media strength personality. What system of training should one use?\nThe answer is simple, it is the one that works. It is a system that requires relative minimal effort but yields maximum results.\nHowever a simple answer can lead to a complex question. Such as, can you correctly define the parameters of what the individual relative minimal effort is to obtain desired results?\nTo date, the most effective system of training for chaotic tasks is evolution. Sadly, that takes too long to have an acute effect on the athletes we train.\nHowever, even with our own bias, we find the Westside conjugate method to be the foundation of choice.\nWhy?\nSimply because its dynamic. Be Dynamic Having a fluid (Dynamic) training system is critical. The Conjugate System that Louie Simmons has pioneered for the modern-day strength coach is possibly one of the most objectively focused, misunderstood, and pertinent data-driven systems of training there is. Every week we know how strong our athletes are. Every week we know how fast our athletes are. Every week we know precisely what areas of weakness need to improve upon, (Simmons, 2005). So at a minimum, 52 times a year there is a checks and balances approach to optimal athletic training based on objective data.\nAt any time, we can alter the program (moving the spotlight) to eliminate any weakness found. We can listen to personal feedback from an external coach, turn this into an objective task and build the required capacity to give the athlete the best chance at defined goals. Whatever your approach maybe to training it can only be as successful as the data you base it upon. So take caution at the start because missing one minor piece can have major consequences. Assessment ‘You can’t take the effect and make it the cause.’ - The White Stripes\nThe art of assessment is slowly and steadily decreasing to make way for the fast pace, instant gratification, and informed social culture we live within. We immediately jump to conclusion on why this happened, or this injury occurred because of… Or the dreaded, to relieve this pain you MUST have surgery.\nAn athlete is sprinting and cuts left to avoid an obstacle. POP, they Rupture their ACL. Is this just bad luck? Is the ruptured ACL the effect of poor training? Alternatively, could it be possible that this athlete has not had a functioning hip socket for years, has been training intensively with this lack of capacity and has been merely an injury ticking time bomb? If that is the case and surgery happens, history will end up repeating itself, and they will be deemed “unlucky” or “plagued” with knee injuries. Treating an effect is not treating the cause. The micro dictates the macro.\nRemember we live in a world where subjective data (opinions, posts, tweets) is the dictator. Stay objective. You must show well chosen factual data and use this to create a rationale for protocol design.\nSubjective athletic data + External subjective analysis = High System Error Probability\nObjective athletic data + External subjective analysis = Low System Error Probability\nFinally, work with a COMPETENT FR manual therapist and assess from the joint outward. Create an environment that autoregulates to provide optimal growth. Listen and Learn from athletes.\nRemember we live in a world where subjective data (opinions, posts, tweets) is the dictator.

Create an environment that autoregulates to provide optimal growth. Listen and Learn from athletes. Culture Watching and learning hands-on from Louie Simmons, listening, reading and meeting such authors and coaches such as Charlie Francis, Dr. Stuart McGill, Steven Yee, Dan Pfaff, Marcus Marinelli, and many others have derived many fundamental similarities. One such fundamental is they all know more about the athletes they train and work with than the athletes may know themselves. How?\nThey observe and listen to everything said and done. Every conversation yields valuable knowledge to them no matter how trivial it may seem.\nDid you know that every training day Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell buys breakfast for all Westside athletes, visiting coaches, or anyone that is going to be a part of the given days training. It allows everyone to interact and create a close-knit community (Tribe). Sometimes this creates a unified point of view, other times, alpha mindsets will fight tooth and nail for what they believe is correct even though common consensuses states otherwise. Which inevitably starts a debate that generates an accurate answer. This culture leads to one desired mindset, to be the best. An environment like this quickly identifies any cracks in their armor and more so than not it tends to be psychological than physiological.\n“Don't have a million dollar body and a 10 cent mindset” (Louie Simmons) Mental Capacity Becoming ANTIFRAGILE - (Taleb 2012) How do they cope with stress? If an athlete who has an issue with performance-related stress or they play within an incredibly stressful environment, has this addressed this within their training?\nWeakness is a weakness, and it must be addressed. Thus, It Needs to Be Trained.\nStructuring training sessions with initial and incremental microdoses of stressors (Chaos) is vital. It may seem random to the athlete but they are strategically placed in the workout to increase their tolerance to it. When tolerance increases so do the stressors. This will increases the confidence of the athlete as they have established prerequisites of mental capacity for chaotic problem-solving. The ability to get through a variable intensity workout, to not quit from a workout designed for an athlete to push the self-imposed boundaries, and to break personal records all accumulate for external positive outcomes. Never underestimate the increase in mental capacity gained from correct training systems. Confidence is confidence, it is contagious, so much so that it will spill over into sports performance. Don't Overestimate Self-knowledge It is common to hear the phrases 'you do not know, what you do not know' or 'you are blind to your blindness. Have you ever asked, what does this mean? Too many coaches do not broaden their scope of research or training. Attend one of the many strength coaches shows in America where the same recycled information is dressed up, presented and digested as the latest and greatest. The same holds true for sports science. It is continually developing and has many new, fantastic software and data tracking availability. Sadly injury rates are still too high regardless of how good technology is.\nSports Science technology is limited by the interpretation of the end user of which is usually a strength coach. So, if a strength coach does not broaden their scope and understand the difference between signal and noise regarding data and technology for the betterment of athletes why spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on something that will not last or make the coach better at their art.\nDon't let unnecessary data dictate training. Most non weight room data should be used as an periodic review to aid with assessment. It should never be used as the sole driving force for protocol creation. Understand lots, but Master one's craft A head strength coach must have an understanding of a wide range of fields allowing them to identify potential areas of weakness that need to be improved upon. Don’t mistake this observation for mastery. Let bias and ego subside and utilize the help from masters in the relevant field as it will provide a threefold positive effect. One, the athlete is immediately receiving valid inputs to solve a potential problems/weakness. Two, vast amounts of time have saved of which a head coach can put towards their strengths. Three, an increase in self-education, (and your athletes), by just having someone smarter than you take the lead. Some areas of enormous educational benefit to make outside the linear scope are the following; Military strategy and tactics\nJapanese and Chinese Philosophy Lean management systems\nComplexity science\nHuman behavioral biology\nSystem Dynamics Hopefully these eight simple points will provoke a small change of thought that will lead to big outcomes.\nTom Barry Cited Material Connolly, F.

At that first meet I was lifting along side four IPF future world champs: Larry Pacifico, Vince Auella, George Crawford, and Milt McKenzie. That experience changed my life forever, for good or bad.\nSince then I have authored eight books and numerous strength articles and I have acquired 12 United States patents. I am not stopping any time soon. Lifting is Repeating Itself I made Top 10 for 34 years—with gear and without gear—in all four categories. But of late, I hear the controversy about one or the other. The so-called Raw Lifters are going down the same path of the Gear Lifters without seemingly knowing. In 1973 I lifted without gear—no knee wraps, meaning not even ace bandages—a weight lifting belt and a two-hour weigh-in. Today, one would use a three-meter knee wrap, four-inch power belt and, after a 24-hour weigh-in, a 198 is lifting as a 181.\nOur Gear Lifters started the same way. First, they used one-meter then two-meter and now three-meter wraps. Even the singlets today are equal to the old spam-jam lifting suits. Like it or not, lifting is repeating itself. Night Riders\nAnything or anyone inspires me to do better. While I don’t watch many movies, some have inspired me to continue competing after doing so for 51 years. Books have also played a key role in my life in general. I have always seen myself or others mimicking the fictional characters in books or on the screen. (Mad Max (1979)) I realize that a man of science will be remembered for decades, but a powerlifter is forgotten the day after he retires. I will not divulge the names of the lifters I will be writing about, as what happens at Westside must remain at Westside forever. Years ago a Top 5 Lifter abruptly quit lifting in one day. He showed up at a party I attended and told me he did not miss powerlifting. I told him powerlifting did not miss him as well. One of my favorite movies is Mad Max. The movie is full of revenge as Max is in law enforcement fighting against a lawless motorcycle gang. His first encounter is with a crazed member of the gang called The Night Rider who is out cruising with his biker bitch with a chain around her neck. He says to her, “I am a fuel-injected, suicide machine, a real cop killer.” But at that time, Mad Max appears out of nowhere and plays a game of chicken with The Night Rider and wins. Then, Max bumps him from the rear and the Night Rider starts to cry and says to his biker bitch, “I lost it, I lost it, I lost it.” Over and over he says it and then he crashes and dies. I have seen a lot of Night Riders in my time. It could be someone who just started and swears they are going to break a world record, but when they find out how hard it is and the work it takes to be a world record holder, they quit. Or, they can be on the top of the world with world records and then say they are done with powerlifting for no apparent reason. Either way, they are a Night Rider. Johnny Boys\nThe leader of the gang was named The Toe Cutter. Two of his gang members were Bubba and Johnny Boy. Bubba was his lead man. Whatever The Toe Cutter needed done, Bubba was the guy.\nOn the other hand, Johnny Boy was a complete f-up—always doing stupid things and getting into trouble. He could not keep his mouth shut. He had done nothing; he was never going to do nothing, but always was talking out of his ass. There are lots of Johnny Boys on the internet making fools of themselves every time they make programs for lifters even though they are low status, many times because they could not program for themselves. Why doesn’t a high-level lifter train or program others to become better than they are? Ego or lack of knowledge … ok … both. Just because someone is a world record holder does not mean they can help you. Just because you hang around a great lifter does not mean you will become one. Freddie Roach was an average boxer, but is one of the greatest trainers today. Mike Tyson was a great boxer, but never trained anyone to a title fight. Think about it before you pay for a program by a used car salesman, and I apologize to used car salesmen everywhere. Sage Advice Remember Bubba? It’s good to have a bubba or two in the gym. Bubba’s the one who everyone asks to hand out a bench or help set a bench shirt. He always goes to help at meets no matter where they are held, no matter how far, always at his own expense. Other lifters never go to help. They think they are too good or way beyond doing such meager tasks. You know who they are—one of a kind. Remember, it’s good to be a Bubba sometimes. Then, remember Johnny Boy the next time you get the urge to talk and make a fool of yourself. Load that computer, phone or iPad on a sled and pull it around the block for a workout, then go to sleep. Choosing the Sword I have seen just a few movies, but some have given me great motivation. A movie I enjoy is the Shogun Assassin. The movie is about a Shogun that has lost his mind. He believes his Decapitator, Ogami, who has killed 131 of the Shogun’s enemies, is going to kill him, too. So he summons his Ninjas to kill Ogami during the night—this would become no easy task. Ogami’s wife, Azami, has a bad dream about being killed and tells her husband, but he says it is just a dream. While Ogami is away in his prayer room, the Ninjas come to his home while Azami is with their young son Daigoro. They are there to kill Ogami, but cause grave injuries to Azami instead. As Ogami comes inside the house he says to Azami that her bad dream has come true. Bloodied Azami is holding their son in her arms. As she reaches out to Daigoro, she wipes blood on his face in a tender way. She looks at Ogami and dies. Even though Daigoro cannot understand his words, the Decapitator tells Daigoro he must choose between a colorful ball or a sword that is stuck in the floor. His path to destiny is in the balance. If he chooses the ball he will join his mother in death. If young Daigoro chooses the sword, he will follow his father on a road of vengeance, Daigoro is fascinated with the pretty ball, but chooses the sword as Ogami picks him up and says “You are my son!” And, thus, begins a bloody path of destruction. For those who cannot or will not give their all—who will not make Westside number one in their life—they have chosen the ball, whether they know it or not. For those who choose the sword, they have died and a picture has been placed on the wall to prove it. This is the way of Westside. Many people say that we can help them, but what can they do to help Westside? Westside has a long and illustrious history and will have a bright future with the help of super strong and dedicated new lifters. So remember that you can choose the ball or choose the sword, but you must choose carefully.\nLouie Simmons References Mad Max. (1979). [film][film] Directed byR. Houston..

I have never strayed from the way, much like the life of a samurai. The greatest samurai of all time was Musashi. He killed 60 men in death matches before retiring and writing books. Two of my favorites are The Five Rings and Dokkodo (The Way of Walking Alone). Musashi was a master at tactics. In today’s world everyone knows what you are doing and what you are going to do and where you’re going to do it simply by using their phones. Musashi was born in 1584; it was different then. Once Musashi was scheduled to fight at a temple at 6 am or first daylight. As his opponent was walking through the woods on his way to the temple duel at 5:30 am, Musashi jumped out of a tree and killed his opponent. Musashi was challenged by a swordsman who before fighting would meditate until he saw doves fly. His brother who had a bad temper and could not fight well when angry was to second him. Knowing his enemy well, Musashi came to the duel early and interrupted his opponent during his meditation and killed him easily. This angered the brother and he challenged Musashi while angry and was also killed. Musashi knew both of their weaknesses and exploited it to the fullest. Musashi would kill ten times the 60 men today with everyone showing their weaknesses daily on their precious phones. I would like to tell you a story about a young Musashi when he was working to become a samurai. While walking through the woods he was approached by an old master with a chain and a sickle. Like a true samurai, the old master had heard of the exploits of the young Musashi and decided to challenge him before he completely mastered his sword skills.\nFace to face the wise old master managed to use his chain to snag Musashi’s long sword away. This should have been the end for Musashi, but he did the unthinkable for a samurai—he pulled out his short sword that was never to be thrown by the samurai code. He threw it at the old master’s chest, hit his mark and killed the chain and sickle master. Musashi was proud of his victory, unorthodox as it was. He noticed a nick on the blade of his longsword and started walking to the closest village to have it replaced. He saw his master on the road and ran up to him to ask if he had seen his match. Musashi was very proud of his victory. His master looked at Musashi with disgust and said, “You are not a samurai; you are just a tough guy.” At that moment he walked off leaving Musashi to reflect on what had just happened. Stop for a minute and think. Are you just a strong guy or a strength samurai who thinks about your training and always tries to improve on it? After thinking about his master’s words, Musashi continued on to the nearest village. Soon after arriving at the village, he came upon a sword repair shop. He was met by a young apprentice and asked him if he could repair the sword.\nAfter examining the sword, the apprentice’s face took on a curious look and he asked if it came from a chain. At that point Musashi began telling the story of his match with the chain and sickle master. The apprentice interrupted Musashi and gave back the sword saying he could not work on this instrument of death. Musashi took the sword and walked out of the shop. While contemplating what had just happened, he also thought about what his master had said about being a true samurai.\nHe gathered his composure and retuned to the shop to the surprise of the young apprentice. There was fear in the apprentice’s face as Musashi says to him “Will you polish my soul?” while he hands his sword to him. The apprentice takes the sword and looks deep into the eyes of Musashi and proclaims, “I am not worthy. I must give this to my master for only he is qualified to work on such a superb instrument.” I, like Musashi, have valued special strength training as if it is my soul. I work every day to pursue my knowledge to a greater level as if it is my life and soul. I work on my gym and the athletes who train there. I am constantly working on a new training device or method and trying to discover new talent to break new records. In a way, Westside is my soul in every way and everything I do. There are many books I have enjoyed that have changed my life. Some of these include: The Five Rings, The 33 Strategies of War, Hagakure, The Five Levels of Taijiquan, and A Tai Chi Master Will Always Bring Blood. Scott Shetler signed a book as a gift that included a message. It said, “The true gift for me is having countless friends around the world.” Nice phrase. Like Tai Chi, powerlifting must begin with the most fundamental steps. A man must not only do, but he also must think. Two books that made a tremendous change in my life—that made me think—are Jonathan Livingston Seagull and The Call of the Wild. It was 1972. I had made a 1,540 total at 181 pounds. This ranked me number six. At a meet in November 1972, I made a 1,555 total, but was beaten by George Clark by 45 pounds as George totaled 1,600. Everyone was all over George. And, why not me? I know why. I lost to him. Second is not first. My metaphysics teacher told me to read Jonathan Livingston Seagull. It was about a simple gull who wanted to be the fastest gull, which did not sit well with the elder gulls. So, he was kicked out. Soon he was flying close to 200 mph. He thought there must be a limit to how fast he could fly. One day while on the beach he saw a silver gull 100 feet away. In a blink of an eye, the silver gull sat beside him. Jonathan asked, “How did you do that?” The silver gull said, “Perfect speed.” Jonathan said, “What is perfect speed?” “Perfect speed is being there,” he replied. It is a simple thought, but what a concept. By using this concept, my total improved from 1,555 to 1,655 between November 1972 and February 1973. This total was 20 pounds more than the world championship. I visualized my lifts over and over: 605 – 380 – 670. I did this over and over using mental imagery and lots of meditation over the three months of training. I did not think about George Clark or anyone else or anything else for that matter. Today I still own the original copy of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. At 70 I go to bed thinking about how to make my gym stronger and I wake up thinking about how to make my gym stronger. I have rambled long enough, but I would like to mention the other book that has had a great influence on my entire life: The Call of the Wild by Jack London. It is about a dog, half Saint Bernard and half Sheepdog. His name is Buck. He was stolen by the gardener, then sold to drug traders and was to be a sled dog during the Gold Rush. Watching a dog called Curly get attacked and killed made him realize it must never happen to him. Buck slowly regains the primal instincts for survival and fights for his food while at the same time becomes a rival with a lead dog named Spitz. Buck fights Spitz, kills him, and takes over the pack. He is slowly beaten down by the human owner, but a new human gains his trust and takes care of him. Buck leaves the wild and becomes famous. Known as the Ghost Dog, he kills dogs, wolves, and Indians after the Indians kill his master, John Thornton. Buck had to fend off an entire wolf pack. At last an old battle-scarred wolf comes forward only to sniff noses with him. Then the old wolf begins to howl looking up at the moon. All the remaining wolves do the same and know that Buck is the king of the pack. Buck had much influence on the pack making his bloodline a major part of the pack. But no matter what he knows, he can never let his guard down and must continue to strengthen the pack. This is my life. I must stay sharp and do what I must do to improve, not just the best lifters at Westside, but also pay attention to the weakest lifters because they are the ones vulnerable to other gyms. After all, an army is only as strong as its weakest soldier. Like Buck, I have had triumphs and torment while fulfilling my life dream. Sometimes a dream is more than a dream.Louie Simmons",

      "pageContent": "Assessing the Assessment Westside Barbell Tue Aug 07, 2018 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/7c1326062f1b115804ae9b05b7ddad1d_749d4aee-c784-420b-b166-0000fb33f5d3_720x.png?v=1563691497\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\" alt=\"Assessing the Assessment\"> Related Topics: Conjugate Method, Exercise Programming, Strength Training Methods Introduction As a follow on from the last article written, I contacted over 30 professional strength coaches to engage in a conversation about the topic of assessment. While obtaining data, it was evident that content differed significantly from coach to coach, mostly in its definition and implementation. While differences were to be expected due to personality, education, demographics, methods used, etc. I did not foresee the gap between initial assessment and overall athletic outcome. Specifically the hole between accurate internal systems to streamline and optimize data to further athletic development. One unique finding that arose from all these conversations was that 71% of the coaches did not evaluate the assessment; or if they did perform an internal evaluation, there were no means in place to provide significant change. Another important factor to note is that the 29% who incorporated forms of self-assessment, staff assessment, training assessment, and overall systems assessment had lower injury rates, consistent positive performance outcomes, and had higher rates of achieving the end states that were set at the start. As smart as strength coaches are, and as quick as we are to jump on the latest technological advances or methods, we seemed to have lost touch with common sense. Charlie Francis was way ahead of the curve in many aspects especially with his quote: “Common sense is not so common anymore.” Nothing provided below is revolutionary or game-changing as people have published an abundance of detail material addressing each section. However, you will have to read outside your comfort zone to find them. This article was generated from years of practical experience, conversations with open-minded coaches and athletes, and reading only as much as I can comprehend. Everything within it is to evoke critical thinking towards one's methodologies. To all who took the time to talk and divulge information I sincerely thank you. Anyone who would like to send an email to talk about this in detail or to chat about what forms of assessment they have in place, please send with subject line \"Lets Talk About Assessment\" to training@westside-barbell.com Tom Assessment Firstly, let us create a starting point on the definition of assessment. Why? An initial athlete assessment is the linchpin of an optimal training program. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to try and have a valid starting point to generate an educated epicenter to radiate more in-depth conversations. Without an accurate starting point (i.e., Definition), it will be tough to reach goals. The below definition is my best initial attempt to define assessment contextually. Assessment - Creating a contextual hierarchy that generates an optimal increase in physical capacity, which in turn reduces the risk of injury. Thus giving an athlete the highest anatomical chance for success within their discipline/skill by dampening noise and strengthening signal. The goal is now to try to unpack this definition going forward. Starting with Contextual Hierarchy. Creating Contextual Hierarchy It is essential to have industry norms for each sport and position to give initial parameters. However, to compare initial assessment data to these norms will not always provide accurate reference points. A contextual hierarchy is obtaining objective data based on the physical demands one will find themselves within. This information is correlated with one's current physical capacity; generating a valid start point for accurate comparisons for future assessments. This paints a more accurate picture of measurable progress and gives the coach precise information of the athlete's strength(s). Before generating an accurate assessment, some areas of potential contamination need to be highlighted. There are many to talk about, but I will touch upon the \"big two\". 1 - Clarity of Purpose Strength Coaches are a pivotal cog of a bigger picture in the role of athletic development. Some coaches, especially those at a novice level, can get this crucial point wrong. To believe your opinion is of the utmost importance and needs immediate attention and action is the wrong outlook and attitude to have. To let your bias and ego take over means you will have subjective contamination and high levels of emotion in delivering data. Consequently creating negative reinforcement associated with the risk of being afraid to be wrong.\nDeveloping a contextual hierarchy for an athlete has no room for it. It is ok to be wrong in the correct setting. Especially if this leads to the generation of something that is right. Our job is to put forward objective (honest) data for the interpreter, i.e., Head Coach, Athlete, Team, etc.; in order for them to make as an informed decision possible for the creation of a complete hierarchy of training necessary for optimal athletic output. 2 - Values dictate Perception I have witnessed a strong correlation between the views of a strength coach and of the individual(s) they have interned and learned from. Any coach who values critical thinking will build the informed opinion of an intern. If you are only learning how to do and not how to think, well it's in your best interest to get out or pave your way through the internship and ask as many questions as possible. You need to be able to form an intelligent thought and rationale for what you are doing. An advantage you can give yourself over others is to think logically and deeply. The more you practice, the more competent you become, which raises the importance of hands-on experience. Practical experience allows you to put theoretical knowledge into a real-world setting. Quickly you find out what works and what does not and about how much you have learned, or to your dismay, what you have not learned. Though this may seem counterintuitive, I have learned an abundance of valid information from working manual labor jobs, running a business, understanding the basics of manufacturing, and interacting with customers in both positive and negative situations. These experiences have greatly influenced and aided towards my strength and conditioning thought process. Manual labor has humbled many of us to no end. It made interning for 12-15 hours a day for little to no pay a welcome escape. It also taught us to be on time, necessary logistics and to never stand around with hands in our pockets! Sadly I think this foundational pillar of development is lost on some of the current student strength coaches who expect to walk into a paid internship and have never left cozy confinements of the weight room. To conclude, it is common to hear you have to “perfect the art” or “learn the trade” of Strength and Conditioning. Maybe a trade approach to the academic structure of strength and conditioning would not be such a bad idea? This topic may warrant a further article or at least a discussion, but there needs to be a stronger emphasis on practical elements in comparison to theory taught. Now that we know of the existence of possible contamination we shall shift our spotlight to the execution of assessment itself. Thoughts behind Assessment There are many ways to asses. Some more efficient than others but they all lead to much better outcomes compared to those who don't assess accurately or at all. I have boiled down some of what I think the critical parts of an accurate assessment are in the below points. These are not all encompassing but at the very least will generate some conversations and maybe help you self-evaluate your current process. 1 - Micro to Macro Without adequately functioning joints how can we expect an athlete not to get injured? As a strength coach, this should worry you. If you do not know the joint integrity of an athlete, they could be a walking injury time bomb. Injuries could occur within the sport, within a practice, in the weight room, or within recreational activities. Our core job is to reduce the perceived risk of athletic injury to its lowest level possible That's why we start an assessment from inside out or begin with the micro to determine the macro. An athlete should not touch a compound exercise until they have undergone a full intrinsic assessment. Non Negotiable. For an in-depth look into this, please read this article and everything else by John Quint. 2 - Context of Comparison My goal was never to become the best athlete ever; it was simply to become the best athlete I could be.\n~ Michael Phelps Witnessing coaches obsessing overbroad data comparisons to the point of corruption still fascinates me. Please allow me to indulge in self-reflection for the next few paragraphs, as it might prevent you from falling for the same traps that I once naively leaped head first into. During my greenhornS&C days, obsessing over irrelevant data was standard practice. For something that now goes against basic logic, systems, and common sense, was in the past standard procedure. Why? The answer is simple, I rushed. In a mad dash to become “the best strength coach” that ever lived, I was utterly oblivious to learning from the experience and interaction with the athlete. I picked a model athlete, researched EVERYTHING possible on their training, personality, and records. This was to be the athletic blueprint for every athlete that I coached within that specific demographic. One such data-driven episode of S&C malpractice that occurred was of my use of a tendo unit. The reading output showed an athlete was “slow” on the concentric portion of a lift compared to his teammates. No questions, no thoughts, and no common sense because the magic box told me what I wanted to see. The athlete is slow, so I must make the athlete fast. For three weeks I was fixated on increasing speed. That was the all-encompassing focus of training. Little did I know (nor did I ask), that they happened to be performing exceptionally well within their position up to that day of assessment. As you most likely guessed, after the gospel of the tendo had spoken, I had informed the athlete they were not as fast as others, and their performance took a nosedive. Psychologically the athlete's confidence had taken a considerable blow. The weight room training protocol was accurately answering to all the wrong questions, so inevitably that went backward. THANKFULLY! I realized that there was a significant malfunction in the system and it took the loss of a client and the work of four men to generate my paradigm shift from External to Internal comparisons. Louie Simmons Dan Pfaff Charlie Francis Harvey Dorfman (There are common traits to be found between these pioneers so I encourage you to read, watch, and listen to anything you can from them. You owe this to yourself and your athletes.) If I had a simple process of root cause analysis in place, I could have defined the parameters of “slow” by asking a few simple questions such as; Is this athlete slow compared to their previous assessment figures? Is this athlete slow at their given sport? Is a lack of strength speed impacting their athletic performance? If possible to increase speed strength, what is the trade-off? (Speed vs. Accuracy) (Energy System) (Other strengths) Learning from this I began to put in a simple checklist to create four guidelines for a context of comparison: 1- Initial baseline data can be compared to “industry norms” as there is no other available frame of reference. 2- Athletes should be analyzed within the demographic they partake in. 3- Future Assessments must compare the athlete to their previous data. Not others. 4- Only use data for review and avoid using it as a method of athletic cartography. context of comparison checklist Step OneInitial baseline data can be compared to “industry norms” as there is no other available frame of reference. Step Two Athletes should be analyzed within the demographic they partake in. Step ThreeFuture Assessments must compare the athlete to their previous data. Not other. Step FourOnly use data for review and avoid using it as a method of athletic cartography. Just as Mr. Phelps quotes at the top of this section, our goal is to become the best coach that we can be. We must never loose sight of that fact. 3 - Key Performance Indicators (K.P.I.s) Think of KPI's as a tool to ask critical questions to obtain answers of contextual importance. The objective data is then stored within an athletes personal inventory of current athletic worth/output. So to say KPI's are critical is a considerable understatement.\nEach athlete will present their KPI’s as their training evolves allowing you to create strong correlations from the weight room to performance. As experience grows the list of individual KPI’s in inventory becomes more and more valuable.\nHowever, the above statement will only hold true if the system of assessment in place allows for fluid filtration. To take this one level deeper, you must have a method to filter and eliminate the faulty from valid information, (Subjective from Objective), on obtaining optimal athleticism.\nFinally, I highly recommend anyone who can watch Chris Hatfield master class to do so. One of the many nuggets of knowledge from it was called creating a \"One Pager.\" Having a single sheet of paper that gives you a summarized overview per athlete, per sport, per position, is a fantastic tool to have at your disposal. 4- Feedback Loops Communication is critical. There must be a feedback loop between each of the elements of the athletes training (See Diagram 1.2) Any breakdown in communication leads to a system error. The severity of the error(s) will be based on the importance of the information lost or not transmitted. Make sure there is a system in place that allows for information to flow freely between all parties. Everyone's information provides equal merit within the decision-making process. This process needs to be evaluated and tested monthly. It is necessary to have a basic understanding of what a feedback loop is. Even though there are many valid definitions, for the interest of simplicity we will use the following: A relationship between variables in a system where the consequences of an event feed back into the system as input, modifying the event in the future.\nLidwell 2010 When working to obtain optimal physical capacities, we will deal with two forms of feedback: Negative and Positive. Both provide specific streams of information. Thus, it is VITAL to understand the context of each feedback loop, as well as how they function independently and interdependently. For example, a feedback loop can be inverted; meaning that a negative loop can lead to positive outcomes and positive can lead to negative outcomes. Each sport, athlete, organization, is comprised of multiple intricate interacting loops of which system error within one no matter how small can (and usually does) have a butterfly effect on all, leading to catastrophe. In summary, it is not sufficient to understand that there are feedback loops. The context of each loop and its relationships to others on athletic development is critical as it provides holistic clarity of purpose to derive accurate feedback. 5 - Reassessment to Self Assessment Reassessment A head strength coach MUST have reassessment procedures in place to ensure optimal development to reduce chaos. Every stimulus provided via training can have very different outcomes on the individual athlete. Therefore it is of the utmost importance to evaluate the athlete, the system, equipment, and findings regularly.The frequency of evaluation will be case and context dependent. A sample of such frequency can be seen below; Micro Assessment 1 - 7 Days Example - Internal Hip Rotation Example - Athlete feedback, Coaches feedback Example - Weekly review Macro Assessment 4 - 8 weeks Example Maximal Strength Development, Speed Strength Development, etc. Example - End state Assessment Finally, remember it is of no use to have reassessment procedures in place without strategies to implement change, if needed, from findings.\nSelf Assessment Take a simple idea, and take it seriously.\nCharlie Munger The pace at which we try to digest information from feedback while attempting to optimize athletic chaos is so rapid that we move onto the next task without giving ourselves a debriefing. This \"time-out\" would allow us to process and absorb all that has happened. Enter Reflection. One of the most significant improvements I have made to my personal and professional development is the process of self-reflection. Which is a non-negotiable designated time slot where you reflect on everything you have done over a short period (Usually 3 - 7 days). I usually try to do this while in a float tank as there are no distractions and maximal opportunities to think as deeply as needed. Reflexion must become a foundational rule for all. Implementing this straightforward aspect into one's current systems perspective will yield substantial investments of intellectual net worth. Some sample of simple questions to ask; How were my interactions with others? Staff, Athletes, Customers, Family, Spouse What did I Learn from my athletes? How could I Improve? How authentic are my actions and thoughts? Are my athletes getting this best training and information possible? How can improve the weight room experience to maximize athletic results Who in the industry is doing a great job and why? Are my methods objective and with minimal bias? How am I dealing with subjectivity in and how is information being stored and presented? What have my athletes and experiences taught me this week? Final Thoughts The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.\nRichard Feynman An accurate assessment procedure takes time. Usually around four weeks to get specific insight into the athlete. However, after one day you begin to obtain a solid foundation and insight. The data collected will allow for the generation of optimal program development. Whichever method of training you subscribe with its objective is to deliver the minimal amount of stimulus that obtains maximal results. As Henk Kraaijenhof said, “Train as often as necessary, not as much as possible.” Finally, no matter how proper your assessment procedures, training programs, and recovery methods are, the sporting success will be the most sought after and accepted measure of assessment! (Connolly 2017)\nTo have objective data ready to show aims, progress made towards them, and protocols in place maintain order could be the difference between long-term employment/success and failure.

I was born in Ohio and it was the strongest real estate in the world. My first meet was in November 1966 in Dayton, Ohio, about 60 miles from my home. I drove those 60 miles to get my ass royally kicked. I came in 10th out of 11 lifters. I managed to beat a 55-year-old man. I thought “What the hell just happened?”\nI had Olympic lifted since I was 14-years-old and had always placed at least third. My thoughts were not on the old man, but the ten guys who had just kicked my punk ass. I knew already to not look down on those who were lesser than me but to look up to those who are better than me. In that first power meet I met four future IPF world champs: Milt McKinney; Vince Anello, deadlifter supreme; George Crawford, a great squatter; and the incomparable Larry Pacifico, a future nine-time world champ.\nI talked to George Crawford after the meet and told him how I placed and George said: “No one said it was going to be easy.”\nAfter the meet, it was off to the Army where I was stationed in Germany until late 1969. I found a used, early 1967 Power Builder Magazine and it had articles from Culver City, California, Westside Barbell Club. My lifts had stalled, so I tried their methods—box squat rack and box pull, floor press—everything they talked about in the articles. I started making gains immediately. I was sold. There was no gear or special equipment needed, just boxes and a rack.\nAfter getting out of the Army, I started competing in Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky at 181 body weight and I was winning a lot of meets. I took advice from the men who dominated one of the three power lifts. Larry P. told me I had to get a lot better bench if I was to win a national championship. This was 1970, and in 1980, I won my first National with my first Top 10 Bench of 480 pounds as a 210-pound 220-pounder. I called Larry and told him he was right, but I did not think it would take ten years. However, my total was third all time high. He paused and said, “No one said it was going to be easy.” But squatting and deadlifting did come easy. I broke the 181-pound national squat record in 1971. In 1972, lifting in Dayton, Ohio, I was lifting against a new rival—George Clark. He was super jacked and strong, and everyone had forgotten me, it seemed. I totaled 1,555 and George made a 1,600. This was a tough loss for me to come home to with no training partner or anyone to relate to … just a mirror and an AM radio. I was told to read Jonathan Livingston Seagull, and it changed my life to this day. A phrase in the book caught my eye: “Perfect speed is being there.”\nThree months later in February 1973, I totaled 1,655 pounds, a 100-pound jump and 20 pounds more than what Bob McKee had just totaled to win the IPF worlds. I made an IPF Elite Total by more than 50 pounds. No gear at all an with a two-hour weigh-in. I feel it is much harder to do than today’s pro totals; just try it. Pee in a coffee can After making a 1,655 total, I was flying high. On the way home from Toledo, Ohio, I told myself that my back was indestructible and I could make a 670 deadlift at 180 pounds. Shortly after returning home, however, I broke my L-5 and dislocated my sacroiliac (SI) joint, which is located in the pelvis. It links the pelvis to the sacrum and is an essential component for energy transfer between the legs and the torso. I lay on my living room floor for three days. I had to pee in a coffee can as I could not move. I was on crutches for ten months. I was only able to do light deliveries for my company. I was lucky. I had a good boss, the same one since I was 12-years-old. No matter what exercise I tried, it did not help. It is worthless to do nothing in battle One day while meditating, no thought became a clear thought. I was thinking about the Reverse Hyper exercise. Once performed, it was the first thing that did not hurt, and it pumped up my lower back. It offered traction for my low Musashi said, “It is worthless to do nothing in battle.” He, of course, was correct. I resumed training. My next big meet was the Junior Nationals in Nebraska in 1977. I made third place. Things were going well, and in 1978-79 I was Top 10 in the squat and deadlift and 4th and 5th in the Top Ten. In 1979, I went to Mississippi for the Senior Nationals. It was called Melt Down in Mississippi because it was 97 degrees and very humid. I was in very good shape at 212 body weight. I made a 733 personal record (PR) squat, a 462 bench press, and opened at a “should be easy” 672 deadlift. The 672 deadlift would put me in second place behind Larry P with no chance of anyone catching me. I recall Rickey Dale Crain opening his deadlift and standing up without the bar—like it was too hot to hold on to. Ricky was very flamboyant when he lifted.Rickey would often come out to the platform saying “Hello, hello” over and over again. To who he was talking is still a mystery to me. But Ricky’s antics became a real problem for the entire meet.\nI remember Bill Kazmaier saying “Beam me up, Scotty.” If I knew what was going to happen next, I would have asked Scotty to beam me up, too.\nWell, back to my 672-pound opener. It came up easy, but as I locked it out, it started to slip out of my right hand. I recall the ref did not give the down signal and the bar got into my fingers and I tore my right bicep totally off. Second place turned into no place. I could not believe what had just happened. The humidity was so high the bar became wet and slippery, almost impossible to hold. The meet was over for me, but I was still on the platform when Larry P came out and handed me an ice bag—he was a true champion through and through.\nAfter leaving the platform, Vince White, a lifter from West Virginia, handed me a handful of pain killers, which I immediately took. I was higher than Alice when she was 10-foot tall and watched the remainder of the meet. I looked at my arm—or where I used to have an arm—and said to Vince, “Man, I had second place locked up and this had to happen.” Vince replied, “No one said it was going to be easy.” “No way, Jose.” Not much bothers me. I started to think back to a meet in Ohio six years before where I was lifting in the 181-pound class and had won outstanding lifter. But then it occurred to me that Vince Anello was lifting at 198-pounds and had just taken a 700-pound opener to win the 198 class. Vince’s helper went over to him and told him I had won Outstanding Lifter, and he would need a 780-pound deadlift to beat me. Vince said he would take it. The world record was 760 pounds by Ed Matz, Jr. for Northern Ohio, so with no planning, not only was Vince going to beat me for best lifter, but he would have to break a world record by 20 pounds to do it.\nI said to myself, “No way, Jose.” But he pulled and pulled until he locked it out. I could not believe it. What a lift, but more than that, what a lifter! It did not make my arm feel any better, but I thought, “I have come a long way, and this arm thing is not going to stop me.” After getting home, I went to three surgeons. Two said to operate, but the third said that if I did not care what it looked like, don’t do the surgery. I said, “Good.” But, I first made sure I could curl my arm all the way up and also fully straighten it out. I started doing high-pin deadlifts moving the bar an inch or two and lowering the pins each week. Some lifters from Blacks Health World came down to see me: Steve Wilson, a monster, Hoss the Boss, and Danny Woebler, who was known for the first 900-pound pulled. I thought while I had some spotters I would try to bench as heavy as I could. I made 485 with no problem. I knew I could start training again. I was done Powerlifting Mike Lambert, the owner of Powerlifting USA, wrote about the Senior Nationals meet calling it Melt Down in Mississippi for its terrible weather conditions. He also said that I was done Powerlifting with such a severe arm injury. But I was already training for the Nationals in Nitro, West Virginia. This time I did not have to lift against Roger Ester as I had decided to stay in the 220-pound class from then on. I squatted 765 easy and called for the world record with 785-pounds, but I felt some severe pain in my groin, so I passed. I made my first Top 10 bench with 480 pounds and pulled 705 to total 1,950, which was third all time. Larry P. said when I developed a good bench I could win a National. He was right. That was the good part. The bad part was after getting home I went to a doctor to see what damage I had done this time. Doc said I had torn two small holes in my lower stomach and had a small tear of a tendon that connected to my pelvic bone. I said, “Doc, are you sure?” His reply, “Lou, if you are going to powerlift, 'no one said it was going to be easy.” “Thanks, Doc.” He sent me his bill. I was in bad pain most of the summer, but I wanted to go to the Senior Nationals in Wisconsin. This became the famous meet where Larry P. ended his nine World Championship run by making a five-pound on his second attempt, which cancelled his third attempt. Well, I pulled out after hurting myself again. Larry P told me I should start lighter and I would do better. He was right. Got Smashed I recovered and started training again. I went to one meet and pulled an easy 722 deadlift at about 208 body weight. Then, I was working in Cincinnati about a two-hour drive each way for 18 weeks. I was a crane operator then and would drive back to my garage gym and work out between 800 and 900 pounds every Friday. I had injured my back again, but I paid no attention, which was normal for me. I worked very late on Friday and had to squat on Saturday with only two girls to spot me. I thought I would low box squat, so the weights would not be so great, although it was 725 pounds. I set the safety pins to spot me if I missed. The box was two-inch below parallel. I missed and sat back down on the box. I then leaned forward to set the bar on the pins, but I had set the pins too low and got smashed between the box and the pins. I could not get out from beneath the bar, so the girls unloaded the bar so I could get the weight off my back. With box squatting from 800 to 900 pounds for 18 weeks and then getting smashed with 725 pounds, I knew something was not right. I called my friend Dr. Jim Reardon, and he got me in to see a surgeon on Monday. After the examination, the surgeon said, “I’ve got bad news.” He wanted to take out two disks, fuse my back and take off some bone spurs. He wanted me to come back in a week for surgery. I never went back. But, I thought to myself, “No one said it was going to be easy.” Patellas Blow I rehabbed myself with acupuncture, acupressure, Reverse Hypers, and stretching for six months. And then I started to train heavy again. I was not able to compete much as my work kept me too busy. I made my fifth Elite Total in Toledo, Ohio, the same town where I had made my first one. This time it was different because my first three Elite Totals were with two-hour weigh-ins and no bench shirt. Now I had a bench shirt from Frantz, and I got 20 pounds out of it with a 500 raw bench and a 520 shirt bench. Another difference was that I weighed only 235 pounds when I saw Toledo about 15 miles away. I had a young Chuck Vogelpohl with me, and I started drinking Gatorade all the way to the weigh-in. After getting on the scales, I was 240 pounds. The judge said I was good, but I said I needed to weigh over the 242 limit to lift in the 275 class. Chuck handed me Gatorades until I made 243 pounds. At that time, only Mike Roy and Dr. Squat Fred Hatfield had five Elite Totals, and now I had five. Fred Hatfield had a lot of influence on my lifting and on how I understood strength in general. He had five Elite Totals. I had wanted five Elite Totals, too. Back then it was based on strength, not on gear and body weight manipulation. I was doing well, working a lot and not competing, just training. Matt Dimel was the world record holder in the SHW with 1,010 pounds. He was trying 1,020 in the gym and blew off both patella tendons. Then, while in the hospital, he had an adverse reaction to the drugs and blew off both quad tendons. Matt said, “I can’t believe this happened to me!” I said, “No one said it was going to be easy.” Matt recovered and squatted 903 to win the Senior Nationals.\nI had seen a lot of patellas blow, but I never thought it could happen to me. I was not working, so I had good training and was taking a low, soft-box record. I was tired but liked to try all-time records when I was not my best. I made a 735-pound for a record and felt my knee cap move. Then, two spotters got into an argument about if they could lift the bar off the pins. Remember, no mono lift in 1991. Chuck V. got mad, and so did I, and Chuck said, “Take another.” And I said, “Put it on.” Seven hundred and sixty pounds was loaded, and I forgot about my knee until it had a complete rupture of the patella tendon. I could not believe what just happened. I had forgotten that I felt my knee tear only five minutes before. So, now I was going to the hospital for surgery. I am very allergic to anesthesia, and they gave me a spinal. Fourteen weeks later I go back to the hospital to have the wires taken out. I was given a shot to calm me for surgery, but as I was dozing off, they gave me anesthesia. I stopped breathing. Four minutes went by before they performed a tracheotomy and inserted chest tubes – both while I was semi-conscious—and then sedated me. Forty-eight hours later I came to and found I had a lot of things sticking out of my body, but I hadn’t had a knee operation. I was not in a good mood at all. Air tube down my throat So while they had an air tube down my throat, they operated on my knee. They wouldn’t release me for seven days. I was picked up from the hospital on a Tuesday by my wife and Chuck V., and I went to the gym. On Sunday I drove myself to the gym and was told I had to max out on the bench. I made 355 pounds. I have never been discouraged in my life, and I was not going to start then. I was not going to compete again. After all, I thought I had done all I could. But, I found I was just beginning. I began to receive U.S. patents. I had a business and a gym named Westside Barbell Club in honor of the Culver City, California, men like Bill West, George Frenn, Pat Casey and Joe DiMarco, Superstar Billy Graham, and all the bodybuilders and Olympic athletes that trained there. The gym was doing great, breaking world records and continuously improving the training methods I started using in 1982 after I broke my back for the second time. I knew in 1982 I had to find a better way to train, and the former Soviet Union way was it. I will always be indebted to all the Soviet Union sports scientists for their endless work for improving training methods. I was told many times that no one said it was going to be easy.\nBut all the pain and work was paying off. The 1990s were great with the greatest group of lifters Westside had ever assembled, winning the APF Senior Nationals several times. At the Worlds, Westside scored the top six for team points. Westside had four firsts and two second place finishers. Westside won the WPL Worlds twice. Kenny Patterson and the guys went to Texas for a money bench meet. It was to be the Anthony Clark show, but K.P. won and surprised everyone by winning and breaking the world record in the 275 class. Westside had three world record holders at that time and won a lot of money. Westside went to Lumberton, North Carolina, for a money meet to win $8,000. I called first and asked if they really had eight grand, and they said yes. So I told them to have it in small bills because we would be down to get it. Well, we won it all. They said they did not think any big names would show up. I said, “Are you kidding? For eight grand we would go to Mars.” About that time K.P. had some minor shoulder problems and had stalled, not going anywhere. To psyche him, I said I was going to come out of retirement and squat 700 pounds. He said, “Old man you will never have 700 pounds on your back again.” It was that moment that I came out of retirement. I had great training partners like Chuck V., Dave Zippy Tate, Joe McCoy, Fuss Dog Fusner and Jerry O. to name a few. But from that point on, K.P. was responsible for what I did. Leave me their key and get out My first meet back, I totaled Elite at 242, but my squat was 760 pounds—the same weight from when I blew my knee off. But it was no problem. I was back, kind of. I went on to bench 600 pounds at 50 years old when no one had done 550 pounds. I was second in the squat at 920 pounds. I was fourth in the total. I was 6th in the Top 10 in the 220 bench at 54 years old and 10th in the deadlift with 715 pounds at 57 years old in the 220 class. I had a shoulder replacement in 2005 and a neck problem that made it impossible to train with a squat bar. But there was no way I was not going to get back on the platform. Finally, after six years, I was able to go to a full meet. I was now 63 years old and had new goals. I made 730, 505 and 675 deadlift at 217 body weight. That’s a 1,885 total. I wanted to total 2,000, but my neck stopped my dreams.\nSo now I had to have a new dream. I thank Kenny everyday for motivating me to do my very best. The gym is now rebuilding with new talent. Westside holds six current all-time world records, but that is not good enough for me, and I hope not good enough for anyone at Westside, or they should leave me their key and get out. I have 12 U.S. patents and I have written eight books by hand as I don’t know how to use a computer. Yes, no one said it was going to be easy. Tom Barry asked me why I did it and why I never stray from the way. My reply is that all my friends and memories are from the four walls of Westside Barbell and its many locations over the years—starting from my basement to several other locations to today’s 3,800 square foot facility. But in all that time there has never been a sign because no sign is needed. Westside is a mystical place that many seek out, but few experience. In a 15-mile radius of Westside there are 14 men who have held an all-time world record and countless women who have compiled more than 100 all-time world records. And, at present, Westside lifters hold 19 out of the top 25 totals of all time. Like they said, no one said it was going to be easy, but all the pain and work was worth it. Louie",

But Westside also uses the third scientifically proven method—the Sub Maximal Effort method. This method requires the lifter to develop maximum force possible while in a fatigued state, but not to complete failure. More can be found in the book Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. M Zatsiorsky and W. J. Kramer. By using several special workouts, Westside has produced 10, 600-pound raw bench pressers including the late, great Nick Winters with a 700-pound raw bench. The ten include: Nick Winters\nKenny Patterson\nGeorge Halbert\nRob Fusner\nJ. M. Blakely\nJ. L. Holelam (Check spelling)\nPaul Keyes\nMike Wolfe\nA. J. Roberts\nDave Hoff They had several special workouts they rotated on both M-E day or on Dynamic day. Avoiding accommodation by changing the reps, angles, and grips is key to success. Two workouts were used in place of the Dynamic Method. They used two workouts for the Repeated Effort Method. First, let’s look at a program that was shared with me from Bill Seno, a Chicago power lifter and high-caliber body builder who won many “Best Chest” awards. It called for using a very wide illegal grip. You start with six sets of six reps and a weight that is fairly easy so as to jump five or 10 pounds each week for three to five weeks until it is almost impossible to complete. At this point, reduce weight and start over with eight sets of eight reps. Again, add five or 10 pounds a week until you find it almost impossible to complete. Again, reduce weight and start over with 10 sets of 10 reps. Work up for a few weeks until you again cannot add weight. Now it is time to return to six sets of six reps. You will find that your plateau is now much higher. Repeat the sequence. This program brought my raw bench from 340 pounds at 172 bodyweight to 450 pounds at 175 bodyweight to 500 pounds at 197 bodyweight. This has worked very well for some at Westside. Thank you, Bill Seno. The second workout calls for a high volume dumbbell workout using at least two angles. After warming up with lighter dumbbells, choose three weights to test yourself for three sets of eight to 10 reps of pressing from two angles. Two examples are flat/incline or seated/decline. Your goal is to set a single set rep record and a three-set record for total reps. I was no match for our 600-pound plus benchers, but my best with 155 pounds was 13-11-9. With 125 pounds, I managed 23-21-19 reps on a flat bench. Most will have to rest about six minutes between sets. Remember, you must choose a second angle. You may not be able to use the same dumbbell weight while doing flat or reclined pressing compared to seated or inclined pressing. Let’s look back at the 6-8-10 set of reps for a comparison from doing nine sets of three reps on speed strength day. When using 225 pounds for nine sets of three reps, it adds up to 6,075 total volume. When doing six sets of six reps with 225 pounds, it adds up to 8,100 pounds of volume. And when doing eight sets of eight reps, now the volume is 14,400 pounds. And 10 sets of 10 reps with 225 pounds would be 22,500 pounds of total volume. Two hundred twenty-five pounds can be done by the majority of lifters. But, think when you become much stronger, 315 pounds for 10 sets of 10 reps will be commonplace. That’s 31,500 pounds! After building a base from the high reps, you can concentrate on doing just one top set of six, eight, or 10 reps per week. Try a new single rep record with an ultra-wide grip every three weeks. Then, reduce weight and work up to a max close-grip record. The close-grip should be with the index finger touching the smooth part of the bar. This second workout is much less volume, but you reach a one rep max much faster than doing the high reps. Chest flys and lots of tricep work is very important while doing this program. Here is a dumbbell workout: Using dumbbells is a fast way to build muscle mass. Remember the three-set system? Don’t forget to choose a second angle for three more top sets. Afterward, do front, side and rear delts. Upper back and lat work will conclude the workout. For building mass, do incline and decline work. Work up to a single, three or six rep max. Then, go to a second angle. For example, incline first, and then go to the decline press. The next time, do the decline first, and then incline. My best, very steep incline press was 370 pounds close grip. Then I broke a record with 315 pounds, then 275 pounds, and last 225 pounds. Follow a workout that compares to this. Then, do as much tricep extensions as possible finishing with side, rear delts and upper back. Two more strength and mass builders are dips and pushups. Dips with body weight or with weight, when possible, will build a strong chest, delts and arms. Do full dips first with different grips. For extra strong triceps, point knuckles toward each other. To overload, stand on a box and do weighted-dip lockouts. As you become stronger, add weight or lower box. My good and very strong friend Jesse Kellum would hand walk on his special set of 80-foot dip bars to build tremendous pressing power. One final note, press at all angles from flat to seated to even standing up. What about the lower body? How can you add volume to your low back? Start with reverse hypers. If your squat is 400 pounds, we have found that you need 4,800 pounds of squat volume. Westside also has found that your reverse hyper volume is four times your squat volume. This means 20,000 pounds for a 400-pound squat, and 40,000 pounds for an 800-pound squat. A 1,000-pound squat requires 48,000 pounds of reverse hypers two times a week. Plus, two days a week, preferably, one-half the volume with 50 percent of the weight on your two lower body days. As you can see, adding reverse hypers to your program can increase the volume for the lower back, glutes and hamstrings. The Athletic Training Platform (A.T.P. ®) is a major part of the programming for higher volume for the lower body. Belt squatting is the base of our squat and pulling power that includes the Olympic pulls. Enormous tonnage can be used with the A.T.P. A combo squat and deadlift performed on the A.T.P. has made it possible for 25, 800-pound deadlifts, plus over 900-pound belt squats. Power cleans and snatches are done for the upper back. The Reverse Hyper® and the A.T.P. provide spinal traction while making the lower body strong. They played a large role in making it possible for 92 men who have squatted at least 800 pounds. A third method to raise volume for strength as well as restoration is power walking with a weight sled. To begin, hook the sled strap to your power belt and walk forward, and backward, for trips of 60 yards. Walk with a long stride, heel first. This should feel like the start of a calf-ham-glute raise. Use heavy weight on Monday and make eight to ten trips. The track girls at Westside use 180 or 235 pounds for their trips. Backward walking will hit the quads and hips in the front very hard. On Wednesday, drop your weight 45 to 60 pounds and make eight to 10 trips. On Friday, use two plates or 90 pounds and make six trips for a warmup before squats and pulling. If your hips are weak, hook the sled straps around your ankles and walk with long-as-possible steps, which will build the hips. Sled work does not require loading the spine while adding volume to the training. Well, there you have it—many ways to build muscle mass for the upper and lower body. Some of this work can be on a second small workout, or take a short 30-minute break and do the extra special work noted above. While it is perfectly alright to do compound exercise for the upper body at any angle, the lower body training cannot sustain the constant compression on the spine. For this reason, single-joint exercises like the Reverse Hyper should fill the void for lower back training. The A.T.P. has a similar effect on training by constantly reducing spinal pressure by having the belt secured around the waist. The belt also helps increase intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which protects the spine. One last note on back safety: As the barbell load increases, it is advisable to wear a weight belt. In the Science and Practice of Strength Training, by V. M. Zatsiorsky and W. J. Kraemer (2006), they show on page 150, Fig. 7.15 the amount of IAP with no belt, an Olympic weight lifting belt, and a special belt with abdominal support much like a four-inch Powerlifting belt, which was designed by Zatsiorsky. This is scientific research to prove why you should wear a belt. Read it for yourself. Always train your abs.\nLouie",

Today's topic is low back pain syndrome. We're joined with John Quint and Travis. Louie, I'd like to get you just to start off talking about the low back pain syndrome. What it is, and what you have done to rehab backs, and not even just that. But to keeps backs healthy, and not to have back injuries.\nLouie Simmons: Well instead of low back syndrome, we prefer to have prehab for healthy backs. We don't have rehab, we like prehab. We like to keep our backs strong. Basically, a strong man or woman has a strong back. Many women have weak lower backs, and that pretty much sums it up. My experience starts back in very oddly, 1973. I had the highest total in the world for a while [inaudible 00:01:01]. No gear, and I broke my L5 and basically dislocated my SI joint.\nLouie Simmons: I was on crutches for basically 10 months off and on. Finally came up with reverse hyper exercise, and that's what got me back on the road the health. I went back, that was '73. By '78 I was pulling over to 700, 198. That was basically the fourth, fifth best setup in the country, and I was always top five in the total in the squad.\nLouie Simmons: 1983, I broke it again. A doctor, a surgeon here in town wanted to take out two discs, fused my back and take our bone spurs. I refused, and at that point I already was doing reverse hypers that's how I started. So I did acupuncture, acupressure, I stretched, and I rehabbed myself. Everybody knows, if you want to be successful in rehabilitation, you have to participate in your own rehabilitation.\nLouie Simmons: So that's exactly what I did. I didn't go to anybody, I did it myself. So basically a lot of the problem with backs is a psoas problem. A lot of people treat low back pain over and over and over, chiropractors so. But it never gets better because the psoas is tight. I know John you might want to mention something about this. It basically pulls on the tailbone I suppose, right?\nJohn Quint: Yeah.\nLouie Simmons: It also can cause pelvic tilt. So build strong abs, you have the front of your abs, rectus abdominals, and the obliques are very important. Actually obliques produce higher inter-abdominal pressure than your rectus abdominals. Everyone, you know if you look at your greatest athletes, what's everyone mostly focused on? Of course it's the body, and they look at the obliques.\nLouie Simmons: Great athletes have great obliques. I used to 180, I did side bends of 180. I did not have pretty obliques, but I had pretty big obliques. So I concentrate a lot of obliques, and a lot of abdominal trainings, never done good mornings.\nLouie Simmons: So to start with when you pick a weight, what is the first thing you do? You take a breath of air, and hold pressure in your stomach. So to me, the strongest muscle in the body has to be the stomach. So how do you build the stomach, and make it healthy and have good mobility in the low back? I like leg raises, hanging and standing. When you do them hanging, or you can add ankle weights when you're very strong. Sit ups, incline sit ups, weight on the chest, weight behind the head when you're strong.\nLouie Simmons: If you have a healthy psoas straight leg sit ups will have no effect on your back. They should have no effect. Always, if you do then you need to get someone, an ART person and get that psoas worked on. A lot of side bends, heavy dumbbells, kettle bells, barbell on your shoulders. Twisting, you can do it standing, you can do it sitting. Standing abs are one of my favorite.\nLouie Simmons: I do a lot of standing abs statically on a lap machine. You basically stand up, face away from the machine, take a tricep rope, hold it against your chest, fill your belly full of air, and bend over. You're not involving the hip muscles, extensors and so forth at all. So it's all abdominal work, and that's one of my best types of abs I like to do.\nLouie Simmons: Another for more advanced people is sled walking with a strap around the ankles. This has been tremendous for all of our athletes, power lifters, athletes of any kind, and makes very, very strong stomach muscles and hip muscles, which should work together. A lot of people want to develop, but the muscles have to work connectively. They have to work together, they just can't work out one muscle at a time.\nLouie Simmons: A lot of real strong people look strong, don't necessarily are strong. It's not because they don't have the muscles, it's 'cause they don't have the coordination. You want to ... Travis I know you lived here, you made a lot of progress since you've came here. Can you just briefly say what you do for back health?\nTravis: What I do, of course I do a lot of reverse hypers, upwards of about 100 reps. With that about 450 lbs typically was what I use on a typical day.\nLouie Simmons: So you're doing about 45,000 lbs of reserve hypers right now. You need to squat right around 900.\nTravis: Yep, exactly. So doing a lot of that like you said. A lot of oblique work is something I've been focusing on a lot more, it's helped me stabilize my squat. Straight legged sit ups on the [inaudible 00:05:35], things of that nature I've been doing.\nLouie Simmons: Yep. John, I'd like for you to speak 'cause we started out talking about the psoas and what a problem area it can be. It can destroy people's backs. Year after year, they get worse and worse, even though they're getting back treatment. I like to maybe have you talk about that.\nJohn Quint: Yeah so as a therapist, I'll talk about how I kind of use the reverse hyper from a therapeutic standpoint. So when you're talking about the lumbar spine specifically, there's five spinal joints. You want to make sure that they have independent segmental motion in between there. The majority of back injuries are going to occur when the lumbar spine goes into flexion.\nJohn Quint: So the first thing I do when I have somebody that has chronic low back pain, acute low back pain, as I start work lumbar extension, 'cause that's the primary curve of the lumbar spine. So you always want to restore lumbar extension before you go into flexion, especially with the majority of injuries being in flexion based.\nJohn Quint: So what I do is I put them on the reverse hyper because the reverse hyper puts them in a \"neutral spine.\" Then from there you can start to work actual extension, and start to get the spine to actually be able to segment. When I mean segment, I mean the lumbar vertebrae is being able to move independently of one another. So kind of get that coordination back into there.\nJohn Quint: Then on top of it it's a safe setting, because obviously your stomach is blocked from going into flexion, which is probably where you injured your back. You can start to restore that primary curvature in the lumbar spine. Start to get the discs to actually get fluid in there, 'cause you're starting to create that pumping mechanism.\nJohn Quint: Generally this is always in an unloaded position. Then after that it's a lot easier to go in there and actually start to assess the psoas to see what's going on with the psoas, 'cause that should start to restoring lumbar segmentation. Should start to decrease that tone. Then you can go in there and start to check the psoas for mechanical connective tissue restriction, which could also be inhibiting segmentation.\nLouie Simmons: So you use the reverse hypers actually if there person wants to gain range of motion?\nJohn Quint: Yeah, I use it as ... just like anything, you could squat for endurance, or you can squat for max effort. I use the reverse hyper literally on a daily basis to teach people how to start to gain neurological control over their spine, because that's a thing. Is when that spine doesn't move, they don't know that it's moving. So let's say you have four segments that don't move, well now all that motion is going to go into that fifth segment that is moving, and that's where you have the issue at. So the first thing you want to do is, you want to go into safe setting, where you're not going to go into flexion.\nJohn Quint: But like I said before, when you go into flexion, that's when that disc goes posterior and generally lateral. So when you're laying on there, you're prevented from going into flexion, and you can safely start to have them work extension. They can work disassociation, a lot of time you'll see people just kick their legs back, instead of take their tailbone and start to life it up.\nJohn Quint: So you're basically constraining the system, cuing them so they can start to figure out how to use their lumbar spine. Then after that, then I go in and I make sure soft tissue works significantly easier.\nLouie Simmons: Now we had an ultra runner here not long ago. A fellow ran three days, 70 hours straight. He has quite a problem for back injuries. Basically what you're talking about, correct?\nJohn Quint: Right. So he had no hips and he had no lumbar spine. So he had an issue at that thoracolumbar junction, which is what you see a lot of lifters have. You don't see it here a lot, but I'll see it in the community that I work on as far as athletes. Where it's like, you'll see where it's like basically the lumbar spine, they have no musculature there. They don't have those thick erectors. But right when they get to that T12 area, their back is huge.\nJohn Quint: Then it goes into like nothing. Well it's 'cause their spine doesn't segment. So if your spine doesn't segment and you go into a ... that's the reason why if anyone that I talk to that tells me, \"Hey, I tried the reverse hyper, but it didn't work.\" Well it didn't work, it's not because the reverse hyper didn't work, it's because you brought a shitty back in there. So you better use that machine to actually acquire the back. So before you do it loaded, get the segmentation then go in there.\nLouie Simmons: Yes. I know you do quite a bit with a dual pendulum. Can you explain why?\nJohn Quint: Yeah. I like the dual pendulum because it just creates more disassociation. You can use one and the other, so the dual pendulum from an athletic perspective is kind of like the ultimate machine. Because you're not really ever doing, you know it's always one limb in front of the other. But yeah, that's going to start to create. So then it's like when you get into the arthrokinematics of the spine, if you have segmental flexion and extension, now you can start to get rotation in there.\nJohn Quint: So let's say, even if it's not the dual, or the which one?\nLouie Simmons: The dual pendulum.\nJohn Quint: The dual pendulum, then you can start, if you're doing one leg at a time, now you're getting flexion, extension, and slight rotation in that spine. So you're just therapeutically ... you can either do it from a ... it's just like anything else. When you train abs you can train them really hard, or you can train them light just to get blood flow in there. But realistically it's your spine, so you better take care of it. You only have one. So you better make sure that you have segmentation in there, so that your discs can stay healthy so that when you go to squat, deadlift and all that other stuff, you're not putting all that load on to just one or two segments.\nLouie Simmons: Right, your waist has four sides. Don't forget that folks, it's just not in the front. You have your obliques on the sided, and your lower back on the back. I know a lot of people use reverse hypers even all the time. They have basically a weak glute. But by using the dual pendulum, you can correct that because it is bilateral. And you can fix a bilateral deficit by using that very, very quickly.\nJohn Quint: Yeah, that's the biggest thing is, you can use the reverse hyper, like if you're a coach or a therapist, you can use it as both a training mechanism, and you can also use it as an assessment mechanism. 'Cause as soon as you see them do it you're like, \"Oh this person doesn't have a low back.\" So that's what a lot of people do. You don't just want to continue to load it, take them ... that is the perfect position. Because at one point we were all quadruped. So when you're in that position, you're going to be able to learn how to use your spine significantly better.\nLouie Simmons: Exactly right. When I bring an athlete in here, I never just start them working out. I make them do an inverse curl, I want to check their hamstrings. I put them on a reverse hyper, check their low back, lumbar area and spinal rectors. And belt squat for their hips and glutes. So that's why we do these exercises. Like you said, it's basically a measurement of how strong you are in certain parts of your body.\nLouie Simmons: When people come in, if you have a bad back or want to strengthen your low back, use light weights and very, very high reps. It will pump up that lumbar region down at the very low part of your back. If you want to build strong glutes, you have to use heavy weights. Like Travis, Travis you say you use 450 lbs, right?\nTravis: Yeah, that's what I use.\nLouie Simmons: When I train, the normal weight was 480 lbs. So we're right in the same ballpark. I absolutely [crosstalk 00:12:34].\nJohn Quint: Yeah, and the reason why you want to use high reps on top of that, is because the disc is connective tissue. So it's avascular. So the reason why Lou says that is because you want to fill all that articulating musculature up with blood, and then basically the process of diffusion can occur where you're going to start to flush nutrients out and get fresh nutrients in.\nLouie Simmons: Basically if you tear a hamstring you're black and blue, tear a pec you're black and blue. Hurt your lower back, it doesn't get black and blue. Like John says, very small blood supply in that area. You have to do monstrous heavy weights. You ever wonder why migrant workers don't have bad backs? Because they work them every day. Yeah. Tom, you have anything to say?\nTom Barry: I'd like to go back to the abdominals for a second. One thing I think I need to explain is, actually how to put air in your abdominals. A lot of people take a deep breath and their chest puffs out, but it's never through the stomach. I don't think ... a lot of people don't realize this, but from being around you so long, you constantly breathe in and out through your stomach. I'd like if you could just educate people why you do that, where you learned that from, and you fill your belly full of air, not your chest.\nLouie Simmons: I learned it as far back as 1970, because of Tai chi. Just for relaxation, and minimal concentration. You're so busy, I'm not getting into Tai chi, and I'm not an expert, but I've always done it for my sport, not practicing for Tai chi. But you start out breathing in for three seconds, and out for three. Then you graduate to six and six, nine and nine, and many, many times I could do 18 in and 18 seconds out.\nLouie Simmons: It's very common, you can actually change your heart rate by doing this. But when you wear a belt, a lot of people, like a girl visiting today from Sweden, she's got a bad habit of wearing the belt so tight she can't expand her stomach. We see this all the time. You learn when you put a belt, you want to try to break the belt. Have you ever wondered why your strongest power lifters or even strong men have enormously strong, big stomachs.\nLouie Simmons: What's the biggest thing on a tree, trunk or limbs? The trunk. So you have to have that midsection, it has to be big. It might not be as aesthetic to people, but you have to have a very strong stomach and big one. I have a very big one. I haven't lifted really for seven years, my stomach is still enormous. But it's also still strong.\nTom Barry: I big thing too, I remember reading the Book of the Five Rings Musashi has in there, when you're wearing a robe, you always wear the robe tight enough so you push your belly against it all time, 'cause if not the rope would fall off. So it goes back to then how important stomach training is.\nLouie Simmons: It's funny in this culture, everybody wants a small stomach, suck your stomach in, and that's why they've all got bad backs. 85% I think of people have some type of back issue, is that correct John?\nJohn Quint: Yeah.\nLouie Simmons: About 80, 85.\nJohn Quint: Probably higher than that honestly.\nLouie Simmons: Yeah, we don't have any. I had a poor kid come in today on a visit from India. And he couldn't deadlift 225 lbs. He has a bad back. I didn't know it that he was that honestly weak. So we sit him outside with some girls I have, and I made him drag a sled. I said, \"You have to build a base before you even attempt to lift weights. So build a base,\" he did that and about work and hanging ... he did leg raises on a special machine, and regular abdominals, and some reverse hypers. I have to build a base before I would even let him lift weights.\nLouie Simmons: I want get back to another piece, the reverse hyper like you said, you pretty much said it all rehydrate. Remember light weights, high reps will blow up the low back. Heavy weights going to blow up the hips. Something else people don't do correctly. Whenever you do reverse hypers, you want to put your toes and hells together on a strap model. You squeeze as hard as you can, and it's exactly like squatting or dead lifting.\nLouie Simmons: Many, many times I thought I was going to pull an upper hamstring from doing heavy reverse hypers. It's just like squatting and dead lifting when you do it that way. You want to squeeze together as hard as possible. If you can get up and just swing it, it's not a ... even though it's a pendulum, you have to raise it. You try to hold it, even though you can't lift heavy weights for a split second, you've got to fight it down about two thirds, then relax and it'll pull you under. That's where it opens up the disc and allows it to flood into the back.\nLouie Simmons: Another piece, a very popular piece here. A lot of people want to know why Westside produces so many strong people. So produce strong people you have to have high volume. How can I gain volume without the wear and tear on my back? The best way is for the lower back is the principle power lifting, squatting and dead lifting.\nLouie Simmons: So it's hundreds of thousands of pounds of reverse hypers. Like you said, you do 4,500, but you do that again at least twice a week, and you do hypers two other times. So you're doing somewhere probably 150,000 lbs of reverse hypers.\nTravis: At least.\nLouie Simmons: So direct work on the lower back that much, and we get in our ATP which is a version of a belt squat. We do a lot of static holds. We walk in there, we do step ups. But when you're in there, it actually with the belt around your waist, it can correct so called pelvic tilt. It can pull the pelvis into correct place. So you do all this enormous work, you put a person in for two minutes, they almost die, is this right Tom? And yet, tomorrow they didn't know they did anything.\nLouie Simmons: They'll pump them up so much as they've never been in their life. Then tomorrow they're fine. Now if you did that with good mornings or something, two or three days later you're still paralyzed. But we do all this work, there's one thing you've got to learn as the jujitsu masters say, \"Learn to train smarter not harder.\" We've got people that are so hard headed and refuse to do, and they hurt 85% of the time. Then other people are never hurt. It's very viable to learn.\nLouie Simmons: In 1982 I broke my lower back the second time, that's when I went to [inaudible 00:18:31] training. I realized I knew nothing about training. Anyone can do the barbell exercises. But how do you apply science to training? That's what changed me, and it's changed a lot of people now at this point. Tom, have you got-\nTom Barry: I think a big thing about that is, especially when we have a lot of people who come here after they're injured, or when they're injured. They get a hyper and their back pain eventually goes away. But then they call us up and they're like, \"Well, my back's starting to hurt again, what should I do?\" Inevitably they've stopped doing their hypers.\nTom Barry: So you've rehabbed yourself from the hyper, but even for you, if you stay on every day, because it's like medication. If you have to take it to stay relatively pain free, I think a lot of people don't understand that if you screw yourself up, you've screwed yourself up. There's no going back, it's done. So every day is a process, every day you have to do something for that. Because doctors are wanting to give you a drug every day, so why not avoid the drug and just do rehab, or just go on a hyper. But I think people really truly underestimate after an injury, how you have to stay on it, otherwise you're going to go backwards real quick.\nJohn Quint: Yeah, I think that's 100% correct. 'Cause it's like the minimal effective dose. A doctor's going to prescribe you a chemicals means. Well you take them and have a physical issue. So you have to have a physical dosage. So it's kind of that minimal effective dose.\nTom Barry: It's just masking it.\nJohn Quint: Exactly.\nTom Barry: Yeah.\nLouie Simmons: Well of course I'm 70, my neck is destroyed and my knees are destroyed. But I have already done 100 reps this morning with 350lbs. Tonight I'll do more.\nTom Barry: That's 100 reps straight, right?\nLouie Simmons: No. I do two sets of 40s and 30 reps. I've done 60 reps in one set very strict with 350.\nTom Barry: Yeah.\nLouie Simmons: I like ultra high reps. It's lactic acid [inaudible 00:20:20]. That's what you do John, you're a body builder. When that pain starts to come, you've got to get it. I try to explain to people about working past it. They don't like it, but when I squat, we used to squat with three guys and basically about minute and fifteen seconds I would have cramps down my spinal rectors, not in my hips. You could shoot me in the head and I'd be more brain dead than I am now. But all I had to do is take out a bar, and the work would go right into those cramps, 'cause that's what's doing all the work.\nLouie Simmons: If you don't actually train at a faster pace, you're never going to get extremely strong. If you go on and do X-amount of work, if you squat 500lbs, you're going to use a certain amount of muscle fiber. If you take a complete rest that they tell you in a lot of books, you take a complete rest, do the same way you see muscle fiber.\nLouie Simmons: One method again where muscle fibers are [inaudible 00:21:08]. That's what bodybuilders do.\nJohn Quint: Yeah, exactly.\nLouie Simmons: Yeah. So you have to do it. Is it painful, yeah. Is it fun, for me yes it was fun. I like pain, I don't mind pain.\nTom Barry: Plus your training is done in under an hour.\nLouie Simmons: That's right.\nTom Barry: People forget if you keep adding in them minutes before you know it you've 30 minutes of workout, you're doing nothing. An hour and thirty. And I don't know who in this day and age has that much time to fucking stay in the gym.\nLouie Simmons: There's people in the gym for three hours and they're doing nothing. It just drives me crazy. Travis, when we see people coming, Tom, we see ... I watch people come in Tom, I watch people come in work on a classic work up to 550 squats, took them an hour and a half. I've got 1000 lbs squatters, we're done squatting in 20 minutes, and I'm talking three or four of them. It's up, it's boom-boom-boom-boom-boom. We're out. Then it's into the deads, and that's only 20% of our work. Then it's on to the belt squats, and reverse hypers and reverse curls, sled poles and so forth.\nLouie Simmons: Another exactly, like I just mentioned before about a healthy back. You just can't maybe ... you know if you're at the point where you're hurt, if you have a sled then pull a sled. There's no loading on the spine at all. It will build up from your calves, your hamstrings, your glutes, your hips and your abs. You get very, very strong, then it prepares you to lift weights. Heavy sled dragging I swear made me stronger than barbell training. And people don't want to do it because it's hard.\nLouie Simmons: But on a max effort day I would go outside and pull a sled. So they're in there maxing out and repping, and I'm pulling a sled. I'd peek in the door, see what the hell they're doing, then I'd pull the sled back down. One time I had severe rib injuries and I couldn't squat for six weeks. So I did glute hams, pulled a sled, reverse hypers, and always do abs.\nLouie Simmons: So we had guys come in from the Steelers and [inaudible 00:23:00] university, and two guys 1000 lbs squatters at 920, they told me they had 920. They said, \"Come on, you've got to squat with us.\" I'm going like, \"How am I going to get out of this, because they're visitors.\" So then I did five doubles of 485 and 375 a band. I did that workout like I never missed a step. I never missed a workout. It was actually comparatively easy, and I hadn't done any squatting for five weeks.\nLouie Simmons: We had a makeshift deadlift contest with two South Africans. I come in pulling sleds for about three or four weeks. Pulled 75 dead lifts. It's the sled. Sometimes the simplest thing is the most complicated thing to understand. But you want a simple ... you've got to walk before you run. You start out crawling, and then learn to walk, and then you can run. The basic things is the key to everything.\nLouie Simmons: No one has fundamentals anymore. The whole of America doesn't have fundamentals in life in general, but they don't have fundamentals in sports. I hear this in jujitsu, boxing, [inaudible 00:24:05] boxing. When they come here, everybody wants to be a top [inaudible 00:24:08] power lifter. But you gotta build a big base if you want a tall pyramid. So we work on big bases, that's why we don't get hurt.\nTom Barry: It's because people always see the end process, and that's where they want to start. They want to start at the end which is the successful phase. They don't want to go through, just like build your general GPP base. That's just society in general nowadays.\nLouie Simmons: A manual laborer's going to be stronger than a business worker. If you brought them in, had a weightlifting content the manual laborer would beat him every time.\nTom Barry: It comes back to work capacity. I think people underestimate the central nervous system all the time. Because once you guys are strong, you're strong. Then once you keep that 20/80 rule, we've got 20% of our workouts are on the compound movements, but 80 is the accessory. So you keep up that accessory work with the sleds, you're not going to go backwards.\nLouie Simmons: So you build up all your weak muscles, so they balance out and you don't get hurt.\nTom Barry: Yep.\nLouie Simmons: Yeah, just a few tips. When you're in a gym, don't turn a radio up. Don't use smelling salts. Don't pick your favorite song. Don't do the same exercise over and over and over, that's the law of accommodation. When you go at it and try to get psyched up in the gym, now you're doing a contest max when it should be a training max. Basically I used to like to run my mouth a lot. Get myself in over my head. So I had to take big weights, but I never got my drilling ever rolling. Never had a drilling rush.\nLouie Simmons: So we've seen this over the years, and it does not work. Don't get your favorite song. If I jumped on your ass and punched you, would you turn your favorite song on before you punched me back. I doubt it. So just learn the difference between training and competing. We compete in a gym, but we compete with a low adrenaline rate, and we've got a lot of really strong guys, and they don't burn out. For the most part.\nTom Barry: I heard a thing on the work capacity, back to the lower back, if you're not putting all the emphasis in your stomach and lower back, well then something's going to give out because they're always ... even for benching, everything you do, your trunk is always being used. So if that's not most worked out muscles in your body, then you're going to be injured. There's no way around it. I think work capacity, people just don't understand it.\nJohn Quint: Well think about it too, it houses your central nervous system. So as soon as you start to lose joint function in there, now you're starting to lose receptor feedback. So it houses your central nervous system, so you should have function in those joints. 'Cause if not, you're not going to have the neural drive output, you're not going to have the input from as far as actual information coming into the system. I mean, I know it sucks, and it's not the best thing to do, but you should probably invest in a spine. You only have one.\nLouie Simmons: Yeah. You're right. If you want to be stronger and stronger, you've got to raise the volume, it's the only way to do it. All the people out there that are boxing fans, you take an amateur fighter, he fights three rounds. How did he ever get to four, six rounders, eight rounders, 10s, and 12s? Work capacity. Because maintaining three rounds all the time, he's never going to fight a championship fight. He has to reach work ... and how did he do it? Through spatial means.\nTom Barry: Yeah, okay. I think that's a good little podcast. I'd like to thank John, Louie, Travis. This is another bite sized podcast, we'll be back to you with the next one shortly. <img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/files/tom-barry-_1_large.png?v=1613765399\" alt=\"Tom Barry\"> Tom Barry Tom Barry is a seasoned strength and conditioning coach with over 16 years of experience.

Then, we used nothing but top 10 lifters, many who were or are all-time world record holders, for many experiments that lasted up to 18 months to verify the results.\nHere is a list of reasons we use certain methods.\n1. Why use a pendulum wave for speed strength for the classical lifts?\nThis approach to training by Arosiev suggested this type of planning for all special strengths. This can be found in Supertraining (Siff, Verkhoshansky, 2009). It was used for team sports that required sportsmen to maintain a certain level of strength. In the book, Managing the Training of Weightlifters (1982) A. S Prilepin shows data from 1974 that showed the minimal, optimal, and maximal number of lifts at a certain percentage. If you are training for speed strength where the average speed would be about 0.8m/s, Westside does 25 lifts per workout.\nA. D. Ermakov and N. S. Atarasov’s 1975 data showed for 50 percent of their training doing between 75 and 85 percent. Russia, China, and Westside came to the same conclusion based on 780 highly skilled weight lifters. Westside uses 50-55-60 percent bar weight and 25 percent band tension at lockout. This adds up to 75, 80, and 85 percent at lockout. On the fourth week, go back to 50 percent and start a second wave. All the weights with maximal speed will build speed strength. We use a pendulum wave because there are no wasted reps. Westside is always evolving and found that our lifters can perform five reps at the same speed as two reps. The result, a world record 900 at 105 pounds and a 1,035 at 220 pounds and a squat increase of 165 pounds going from 900 to 1,065 pounds at 242 in five months. For explosive strength use 30 to 40 percent and the optimal number of lifts are 36 lifts, six sets of six reps is optimal with two-minute rest intervals. For recovery, the volume, intensity, and velocity are kept perfect. Now on the fourth, switch bars if possible. This is only 20 percent of our training.\n2. Why use max effort and why not a two or three or five rep max? Let's start with the phrase maximal effort method. It is singular, not plural. This means one rep or a maximal exertion under an isometric condition or in a very slow movement against a maximal load. Remember in a contest of any of the five classical lifts, you do a single, not two or more reps. This builds strength endurance and is referred to as the submaximal effort method. The max effort method is considered best for improving both intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. Remember, if you tackle a football player it is a maximal effort. If you run through the line, it is a maximal effort or you are sitting on the bench. This method brings the greatest increases in strength by using the most motor units. Know this, your body adapts only to the demand placed upon it. This method is intended for large barbell exercises: squats, pulls, Goodmornings. It is not for isolation exercises like sit-ups, leg curls, arm curls, or calf raises. It is used by top athletes who have been taught good techniques, but Westside starts lifters as young as 14 using max effort workouts. But only after a large GPP background. Two examples are Kenny Patterson, who started at 14 and became open world record holder at just 20 years old. Also, Dave Hoff started at 15 and squatted 1,005 at 19 and a 2,435 total at 252 body weight. He became the youngest to total 24-25-26-27-28-29 and 3,000 with no history of injuries. There are two max effort methods. First, you do a training max without exhibiting high emotion. A contest max is done with high emotional state while competing. When doing more than 1 rep, it is the muscles you are training, not the movement. For the same lift, 72 hours should separate the dynamic method day and the max effort day. The max effort day is low volume with the barbell, but at the highest intensity possible on that day. The Russians, Chinese, and Westside count only all-time records in the classical and special exercises, small and large. It accounts for about 600 new records a year. The Bulgarian system calculated the highest weight lifted on a daily basis. It could account for about 4,000 maxes a year in both classical and special squats, pulls, and small special exercises. For sports I have seen an athlete do a set of five jumps onto a 53-inch box. This means they conserved their force production to do five jumps and never produced a force great enough to jump on a 53-inch box. You must learn to produce maximal force on a single attempt. In sports this is a must for blocking a punt, getting a rebound, or spiking on a volleyball court. For more info, read Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. M. Zatsiorsky (1995). 3. Why Compensatory Acceleration Training (CAT)? The late Dr. Red Hatfield (a.k.a. Dr. Squat) brought to my attention in the 1970s that one must accelerate throughout the full range of motion or the total force value is lost to some extent. To train for a fast rate of force development (R.F.D.) it is recommended to use weights ranging from 30 to as high as 70 percent of a 1RM. For explosive strength this is high velocity 75 to 85 percent; for speed strength this is intermediate velocity. Strength speed or slow strength requires one to use a much higher percentage of band tension over barbell weight. Here’s an example: A.J. Roberts during a strength speed phase made a box squat with 700 pounds of band tension, plus 510 pounds of barbell weight that equals 1,210 pounds. During the circamax phase, AJ made 740-pound barbell weight plus 440-pound band tension that equals 1,180 pounds. On meet day AJ made a 1,205-pound meet personal record. For abrupt loading place bands over the plates as well as over the bar. A second method of abrupt loading is to use 200 pounds or 300 pounds of chain that unloads in the bottom of the squat plus bands over the bar. We know by reading Supertraining that the amount of force a muscle can produce changes with different joint angles. It states that the greatest force possible is after the joint passes through the halfway point of the movement. This means that no matter how fast you push after the sticking point the weight becomes easy and the amount of force is decreased due to joint angles. Biomechanically the Fmm is a combination of muscular forces or tensions that undergo two transformations according to The Science and Practice of Strength Training—one joint movement and muscular forces which transform into external force. There are different muscular forces as body positions change. Remember CAT: when using less than a maximal load the Fmm will decrease at the end of the movement regardless. This is illustrated on page 40 figure 2.20 in Science and Practice of Strength Training. It shows the maximal isometric force Fmm to the bar at different body positions. This also happens while doing sports that require rowing, kicking or throwing. CAT makes it possible to produce an increased muscle tension by moving the load as fast as possible throughout the entire range of motion. 4. Why do you use Accommodating Resistance (AR)? The theory of CAT is good but somewhat incomplete. Go back to page 40 figure 2.20 in Science and Practice of Strength Training. It clearly shows that force changes as the bar travels through the full range of motion. But the problem is that it decreases near the end of the lift. You have all missed a lift at near lockout. Figure 2.20 shows why, but how can this be corrected in training? The answer is by using some method of variable resistance. One may think of authors Gones and Nacticus and their machines with their variable lever arms. As early as 1879 Zander developed a strength device to develop maximal tension throughout the full range of motion.\nOne method of variable resistance is isokinetic. With an isokinetic device the speed of motion is constant no matter how much force is developed. Let’s talk about different velocities. Motion velocity decreases as external resistance increases and inversely, maximum velocity Vmm is achieved when external resistance is close to 0, according to V.M. Zatsiorsky in The Science and Practice of Strength Training.\nThe best method of Accommodating Resistance Westside found is attaching chains or bands to the bar. The amount of chains or bands you add to the bar will determine the special strength you want to develop. For explosive strength where velocity is high, the total bar weight can range from 30 to 60 percent made up of mostly chain or band resistance or both. For speed strength, 25 percent of the load is made up with chain or band tension at lockout. Remember, you must have some amount of chain weight or band tension at the bottom of the lift. For near maximal weight ranging from 90 to 97 percent for circa-max training, the band tension is 39 to 47 percent. For example, for those who squat in the 700 to 800 pound range the band tension is 375 pounds. If you box squat 500 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension you should squat 800 pounds at meet time. A 550-pound box squat plus 375-pound band tension, you will squat 850 pounds. With a 600-pound box squat with 375-pound band tension you will squat 900 pounds. Use the same band tension with a 650-pound box squat will render a 950 pound meet squat. A 1,000-pound squat on meet day is possible after a 600-pound box squat with 440 pounds of band tension. To prove this, Westside has more than 80 800-pound squatters and over a 1,000-pound squat.\nNow back to AR. Chains provide AR by first deloading on the eccentric phase, then reloading on the concentric phase. This is the most natural way to provide AR. Band tension has an added bonus, as it provides an overspeed eccentric phase. This is very important as it increases kinetic energy (K-E). This helps the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC). Many think of depth jumps for training the SSC, but there are others. A plyo swing can build reversible muscle action. Westside had a patented plyoswing that loads weight plates plus bands to increase velocity. To increase kinetic energy it is better to increase velocity rather than mass. A plyometric action that requires an amortization phase, also called the shock absorption, lasts only 0.15 seconds between the eccentric and concentric phases. But when sitting on a box or a floor press done correctly, meaning relaxing the muscle while contacting the floor for a brief time, it lasts up to four seconds due to deformation. This is due to muscle and tendon elasticity.\nRubber bands work similar to the muscle and tendon, adding more elasticity that plays an important role in raising motor output in all sport movements. This is due to stored energy that is equal to the amount of force applied on the eccentric phase that causes deformation. This happens during the support phase while running. What if a large man pushed down on a rubber basketball until it flattens out say three inches? Then he slides his hands off the ball very fast? It jumps off the floor due to stored elasticity. This is what happens when one absorbs the resistance on the eccentric phase. So you see, bands work best for variable resistance, but also for adding K-E with overspeed eccentrics, while building, and to some extent, changing the strength curves.\nIt has been said that with lifts that involve many body parts, chains won’t work. They are wrong. Glen Pendley and Travis Mash, two highly qualified Olympic weightlifting coaches have used chains for the two Olympic lifts. The chains must be loaded by using a support set of ¼-inch chain to hold the ⅝-inch chains so they have contact with the platform at all times. Look how Westside places chains on the barbell.\nBands work even better by preventing the force that is applied to the bar from diminishing as the bar reaches the top of the pull. Glen Pendley says it is great for pulling throughout the snatch. Bands can be used on all five classical lifts. You can see an AR device for the Olympic lifts in the 1983 weightlifting yearbook by Bud Charniga Jr. Westside has been using chains and bands on barbells for around 25 years and the author is credited with combinations of resistance methods in Supertraining.\n5. Why does Westside use delayed transformation?\nStarting in 1970 I would raise intensity and lower volume. It was a standard method of periodization leading up to a meet, sometimes referred to as Western Periodization. This was the only meet preparation known for American lifters. Its goals were to reach maximum intensity before a contest.\nBut Western Periodization had a major flaw. While intensity was as high as possible at the most critical time, the volume had been reduced. This was the logic to allow one to focus on only the largest weights possible. But a lifter must maintain a certain fixed amount of volume to sustain a true maximal. It was suggested to drop all special exercises before the competition cycle. This was a major flaw as well. Why do special exercises that benefit your strength then drop them before a meet, the most important time for barbell volume. A 1,000 pound squat must maintain 21,250 pounds of volume up to 28 days out from the meet.\nThis is backed up from Westside data collected from 26 men who squat 1,000 up to 1,210 pounds. Westside uses a 20 percent barbell to 80 percent special exercises ratio for our yearly plan. So how does Westside prepare for all meets? As you know, Westside uses a three-week pendulum wave style periodization from Arosive and others. It was very common for sports teams. All waves consist of 75, 80, and 85 percent at lockout with a combination of barbell weight plus chains, bands, or both. On every fourth week, it is rolled back to 75 percent. Westside uses a delayed transformation of 28 days devised by three renowned coaches: Matveyev, Y. V. Verkhoshansky, and Ivan Abadjiev. These gentlemen’s research made it possible for Westside to reach our highest results on all three lifts on contest day.\nOther sports like track and swimming can benefit from a delayed transformation for important events. Charlie Francis, the renowned sports coach of Ben Johnson, used the same delayed transformation that a top swimming coach used to break world records.\nFor powerlifting it is of the utmost importance to break a squat record at all meets to make it possible to break your total record. The delayed transformation phase lasts 28 days. Twenty-eight days out from meet time, the lifter will use sets with 50 percent barbell weight plus 25 percent band tension. The lifts are limited to 15 lifts, plus 10 speed pulls with 50 percent bar weight plus 30 percent band tension. The special exercises stay the same. Let’s look at two examples: one for an 800-pound squatter and one for a 1,000-pound squat max.\nTo make an 800-pound meet squat you must box squat 500 pounds plus 375 pounds of band tension. It is done on seven lifts after a warmup: 315 pounds for two reps, 370 pounds for two reps, 405 pounds for one, 470 pounds for one, and 500 lbs for 1 rep on a parallel box raw or suit down, no wraps.\nFor a 1,000-pound meet squat, the normal procedure would be 405 pounds x 2, 455 pounds x 2, 500 pounds x 1, 560 pounds x 1, and 600 pounds x 1. The band tension would be 440 pounds or 44 percent of 1,000 pounds.\nLet’s look at A.J. Roberts making a 2,855-pound world record total at 308 with a 1,205-pound squat. At 21 days out, 740 pounds plus 440 pounds band tension for Friday’s squat workout. On Monday, 18 days out, take opener deadlift with plates on 2-inch mats. This reduces leg drive and emphasizes more back function. At 16 days out, opener bench. At 14 days out, 75 percent of 21 day’s max. At 13 days out, normal speed bench workout. At 11 days out, train only special exercises: belt squat, reverse hyper, rows, hamstrings, etc. At 10 days out, floor press to a new max to alert CNS. At 7 days out, light box squats. Saturday before meet, do six sets of speed bench down from nine sets. Monday train lower back and legs like normal. Then rest and focus on weight cut. As you can see our circa-max phase is concurrent with the delayed transformation phase. The weights for circa-max range from 90 to 97 percent. Westside always breaks new records during this phase, but always with some to spare. Remember train optimally. For the high level, do only on new record, as you have the other two lifts to train in the next few days. I hope this gives insight on how we combine our circa-max training in conjunction with our delayed transformation phase. 6. Why not squat to raise your squat?\nThe late, great Bill Starr wrote an article in the early 1970s entitled “If you want a deadlift, don’t deadlift.” His approach to increasing your deadlift was to stop doing regular deadlifts all the time and replace much of the training with special exercises like power cleans, Goodmornings, rack deadlifts, deadlifts while standing on a box, back hyperextensions, and many small special exercises like leg curls, leg raises, and so forth. It is a period of 18 months from mid 1971 to February 1973. This method increased my deadlift from 550 pounds to 670 pounds at 180 body weight. Westside adopted the same approach for the squat. One must squat on a box, and then train the muscles that squat separately. Tony Olievira came to Westside to train fulltime with a 900-pound squat. In three weeks the team competed and Tony made 890 pounds.\nJust like Bill Starr’s method, Westside does not assess squat workout in a weekly plan, but rather evaluates the lifter by first watching their technique to determine if they are starting in the right direction, meaning performing correct biomechanical efficiency. Incorrect technique can lead to first pain, then injury. Pain can limit one from producing maximal strength. Pain from bad technique can reduce your neuromuscular efficiency. This can affect the skill one needs to perform a squat. To perfect the kinematic chain, one must display the correct sequence of muscular actions. This means developing the correct coordination patterns of motor skills.\nNow let’s think. If you have bad form, repeating the same actions will only lead to accommodation, leading to diminishing returns. Tony would not sit back first in the squat movement, but instead go straight down, using the incorrect muscle group, meaning the quadriceps, which can lead to knee injury.\nMore squatting would not correct this. Building the major muscle groups to produce proper technique is the answer. If a boxer would slap you on the right side of your face, after the first time your response would be to block it with your right hand. If the boxer would always try to slap you on the right side of your face, you would develop the muscle action to block it over and over forever.\nOur theory is likewise, meaning we would build the glutes to push back, while forcing your knees out to the side so the lifter starts the squat by sitting backwards, then down. This is the correct muscular pattern. First we must build a specific sequence for perfecting a perfect movement. Arched back Goodmornings play a great role in the process. To do an arch back Goodmorning, place bar in the squat position. Note not low bar. Now with a shoulder or wider stance, brace your abs against your belt. Next, lean forward with an extreme arch in your entire back. Never let your back bend at all. This is a very limited range of motion exercise, letting the bar go in front of the knees slightly, about six to eight inches. Hold bottom position for two or three seconds by super arching your spinal erectors, then complete the rep. Do three to five reps per set, working up to a heavy set, but never let the back lose the arch. To perform while leaning forward, push your glutes out to the rear while pre-stretching the hamstrings. To complete the lift, push against the bar to complete the lift. This is the same biomechanical pattern as the start and finish of the squat. To build the glutes and hips, you can walk in the ATP or do isometric holds. The holds can be for 60 seconds a set, by standing erect while pushing the hips forward and backwards simulating the correct start and finish of a squat or deadlift. A walking set can go up to two minutes a set. This work can be 10 minutes of actual work. This work fluctuates 15 degrees in either the up or down direction. This is a major exercise at Westside for both squatting and deadlifting.\nNext, the hamstrings play a great role in squatting. Westside uses four exercises for the hamstrings. First, we use the inverse leg curl. This is a machine that allows one to do a Russian leg curl first, but reduces some of the athlete’s bodyweight. Take weight off lever arm until lifter is using just body weight. Then place lever arm on ground and you are ready to do a Russian leg curl plus added weight. Next, do calf-ham glute raises with weight. Both exercises rep range is two to six reps. Next, do standing leg curls. This exercise really builds the hamstrings around the knee. And last for building strength for muscles, but also connective tissue, do band leg curls. Here hook a band around your power rack while sitting on a bench and hook ankles through band and leg curl your heels under your glutes for a total of 200 reps a day. Do sets of 50 or more per set. Also, ankle weight leg curls, again 200 total reps per day, 10 to 20 pounds on each foot. Pick bands or ankle weights, not both on the same day. On our max effort day, the deadlift or heavy Goodmorning also help build your squat by building your entire back. Tony always does speed squats on Friday, totaling 25 lifts with an average weight of 80 percent. On Monday Tony does some type of squat two out of three weeks, almost always with a special bar. A lot with a very low box, or onto soft foam with a close stance, which is the opposite of his very wide stance. This training method produced a meet squat in just under six months to 1,065 pounds. That is a 165-pound increase not by squatting more, but by building his posterior chain. A hint for our Olympic weightlifting brothers: stop squatting four and five times a week and spend more time building your back and hamstrings and don’t forget your glutes.\n7. Why do you say track athletes spend too much time running?\nAfter one learns correct running technique, you must increase strength and power.\nWhy do men run faster than women? Simply they are stronger and more powerful. Women’s technical skills are on par with their male counterparts, but they lack the strength and power to run as fast or jump as high. Two things happen when running too much. One, you create a speed barrier. Constantly performing the same speed exercises or running the same distance at the same time, you develop a speed barrier. The athlete learns to run at a certain speed and no faster even if they become stronger, more flexible or have a faster reaction time.\nMany coaches believe to become faster, more running must be included, but because of always repeating the same effort, the speed barrier grows.\nNote: read The Science of Sport Training by Thomas Kurz.\nIf the athlete performs the same training load with the same exercises over long periods of time, the sports performance will decrease. Performance comes from a result of adaptation, but the great sprint expert, Dr. Ben Tabachnik, said to adapt to training is to never fully adapt to training.\nNote: much can be found about adaptation in Dr. Atko Viru’s book, Adaptations in Sport Training.\nProgress comes fast in the beginning, but after a few years in the same program, there is often no change in performance improvements.\nWhile advocating weight training, it must be done correctly. Learn to perform exercises correctly with explosive strength being the goal, and not building excessive muscle mass, adding to the athlete’s body weight. This concept works for any distance from 60 meters to running a marathon.\nDon’t mistake becoming bigger means getting stronger. Remember, big ain’t strong, strong is strong. In Underground Secrets to Faster Running by Barry Ross, Mr. Ross brings up many valid points about faster running. Why should one become stronger and more powerful? Peter Weyland’s study found that force, not faster leg movement, produced faster times. It is greater ground force and minimal ground contact. Ninety percent of effort to run is to overcome gravity. This is about your strength level combined with how much you weigh. In Underground Secrets to Faster Running, he discussed a study found in the Journal of Biomechanics in 1987. It showed that amount of force used horizontally during constant speed is only one-tenth the amount of force used vertically.\nThis is why to run faster, you must overcome gravity. The stronger you are pound for pound, the faster you can run. Remember, the greater the mass, the greater the gravitational pull. To run faster, it requires three things: how much muscular force you can deliver during ground contact, ground contact time must be held to as minimal time as possible, and stride rate, meaning how often you contact the ground. And above all, weight training must be aimed at increasing strength and power, not adding unnecessary mass or body weight. Two methods of weight training are employed: the dynamic method, lifting or throwing a non maximal load with the highest attainable speed. Lifting 30 to 60 percent for developing a fast rate or force. For speed strength, training at 75 to 85 percent of a 1RM. The second method is superior for improving maximal strength.\nThis method uses the most motor units. Maximal speed or a maximal effort is all that should be used to make one more powerful and as strong as possible.\nTo run when the foot strikes the ground, there is a rapid change in both muscle length and the forces developed. This, again, is why strength and power must be emphasized. A study by L Paavolainen in 1999 entitled “Explosive Strength Training Improves 5-km Running Times” supported this idea. The study dropped 32 percent of the running and replaced it with explosive strength training. The weight training increased ground force that decreases ground contact time. The study showed that by decreasing one-hundredth of a second per stride on a 5km race that uses 2,500 strides, an overall reduction of 25 seconds can be made.\nThe more powerful sprinters who produce much greater ground force will have a greater reduction of ground force contact time, meaning a much greater sprinting time. First, however, one must learn correct running mechanics. Second, like the max effort method shows, you must remember that your body responds to the demands placed upon it.\nFor neuromuscular adaptation, one must run at top speed.\nTry to increase the acceleration phase for as long as possible to limit the maintenance phase. That reduces the deceleration phase to a minimum. There are many fallacies like doing the high knee drills, when in fact this phenomenon creates a rebound effect that causes an increase in elevation due to reversible muscular action during the stretch-shortening cycle.\nThe last and possibly the most important part of all this is injuries. Track has far too many injuries through running too much, causing overuse injuries. When a top male sprinter makes ground contact, it can produce 1,000 pounds of ground force. Multiply this with the average ground strikes of 43 and it adds up to 43,000 pounds of force in roughly 10 seconds. The same athlete will never lift 1,000 pounds on both feet at a time in the weight room.\nBut the coach will repeatedly have their athlete overrun and cause them to reach a speed barrier. Charlie Francis said this can happen as early as 13-years-old. I had an Olympian visit Westside who ran in the 2016 Olympics and he informed me that he ran two times a week and only ran 50, 100, and 150 m, never longer. He worked only on acceleration for his 200 meter race. There is time for weight training all year long. It can be done in 25 minutes for athletes who squat or deadlift 550 pounds or less. After a fast warmup 5x5 sets at 275, 300, 325, plus 25 percent band tension will only take 15 minutes with 1½-minute rest intervals between sets for both squats and deadlifts. This leaves 10 minutes for small special exercises for the most important running muscles. For max effort work, working up to a max, doing only singles, takes very little time.\nThis leaves lots of time for your running training and all important restoration.\nLouie <!--\n.studioengine .sse-is-btn, .studioengine .sse-btn{padding: 7px 25px;font-size: 1em;line-height: 2em;display: inline-block;text-align: center;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: middle;cursor: pointer;color: #333;background-color: #d3d3d3;}\n-->",

The deadlift was the big equalizer. Nowadays, the big equalizer is the bench shirt, as some can get more than 300 pounds over their raw bench. I feel the bench shirt is here to stay, but it has affected the deadlift in a negative way. Westside has 26 men over 800 pounds in the deadlift and four over 900 pounds. There are several programs on Max Effort (M-E) day—from rack pulls using three different pins, sumo and conventional stance, some with just barbell weight and some with 170, 250, 350 or 450 pounds of band tension to conventional standing on a two-inch or four-inch box, sumo or with bands of 220 or 280. Westside will also place a second band over the bar. It can range from a light, average or strong band. For the very strong, two bands can be used. You should keep records on the amount of bands you are using to verify all records on M-E day. Many types of Goodmornings are done for a record set of three or five reps: arched back, round back, bent legs, straight legs, wide stance or close stance. Mostly round back is done for deadlifting and arched back for the squat or sumo style. Special note: Choose the type Goodmorning to improve either the squat by doing arched back or an arched lower back and a rounded upper back for the deadlift. Do the deadlift with a band attached to the front of the rack over the barbell. To ensure the lifter must pull the barbell toward the body, start with mini-bands in front. Goodmornings also can be performed in this manner. Start with light bands over the bar. To our good friend Gerry McNamara from Ireland, who has squatted world records of 749 pounds in the 132, 804 pounds at 148, and 903 pounds at 165 pounds, I say “Thanks, Gerry, they work great.” It is good to do some high pin-over-knee lockouts on occasion with slightly lighter weights for shoulder shrugs with close and wide grips. Westside has found that as your squat goes up, so does your deadlift—almost always for the light weight. Of course, as you get bigger, your center of mass makes squats easy, but makes deadlifting harder due to the frontal body mass. This is why there are several 1,000 pound squats and only two 1,000 pound deadlifts. Speaking of squatting, the special squats play a larger role in deadlifting. Angelo Beartanlie, our 165 lifter with a 560 deadlift, was stuck at that 560 until we had Angelo use a close-stance squat on a six-inch box with different bars. The six-inch box squat was done with a long relaxed pause and worked up to a max single. Within a year Angelo made an official 640-pound deadlift sumo style. John Stafford, a Westside 275 pounder, used an eight-inch box, close-stance squat to push his conventional-stance deadlift to 832 pounds. Eddie Copeland of Belgium at 186 pounds pulled an 826-pound deadlift. His favorite special exercise was the front squat. Westside has used the front squat as well to pushup the deadlift. But use a front squat harness. Ed Zercher invented the Zercher lift years ago. Ed would squat down and hook his elbows under the bar and stand up. This is a great exercise for the deadlift and also for the squat. For larger lifters, take the bar off a set of low racks or pins and perform squats until you touch the bar on the top of the knees. One can also take the bar out of the rack and squat down and lower the bar out over the knees as close to the platform as possible. A great lifter from the past, George Clark, pulled 700 pounds at 181 body weight while only doing the deadlift behind the back. A more modern lifter, Brad Gillingham, also used the behind the back deadlift to officially pull 870 pounds. There are many examples such as Bob Barnett a 165-pound lifter who pulled a 675 meet lift while using the Zercher lift almost exclusively. If you deadlift too often you will no doubt discover the Law of Accommodation and your deadlift will go backward. Small special exercises play a large role in our progress. Small special exercises include the following, to name just a few:\nReverse hypers\nBack raises\nCalf work\nAbs\nPull ups\nInverse curls\nShrugs\nSide bends\nSled pulls We have talked about M-E day, but what about the Dynamic day for squatting and pulling? This article is about deadlifting, so let’s look at an alternative to speed work with mini or monster bands over the bar. I am sure you have heard of the Finnish Deadlift Routine. Our friend Danny Wohleber from Cleveland, Ohio, used it to become the first 900-pound deadlifter at 23 years old and at 267 body weight. His routine ran for 13 weeks with mostly simi-stiff-legged deadlifts. Westside has its own version. It runs after Dynamic Method squats and it consists of both conventional and sumo-style while standing on a six-inch or four-inch box and using a special bench press chamber bar deadlift. Each phase lasts three weeks, then rotates to the second and third phases and finally rotates back to the first box and repeats. For three weeks do conventional style for five sets of five reps. Each week you add weight. The workout must be hard, but not hard enough to not finish. After three weeks, switch to sumo style off a four-inch box. For three weeks do five reps for five sets. Remember, start fairly hard, but you must add weight for the next two weeks. And, finally, deadlift using a five-inch chambered bar. Stand on a 10-inch box placed so you can grip the bar about four inches below your feet and do five sets of five reps for three weeks adding weight each week. (Note: You may have to use stiff-leg or semi-stiff-leg style off this high box chambered bar deadlift.) Light-weight men and women can often squat down low to use leg drive at start. While training a woman bob sled athlete with a best deadlift of 375 pounds after 12 weeks of this rotating program she made a 405-, 415- and an easy 460-pound deadlift. Others have had similar results. Remember after speed squats, go to the six-inch conventional block pulls, then four-inch sumo block pulls, and finally, stand on a 10-inch box set diagonally with a five-inch chambered bench press bar set on top of your feet. The deadlift is almost a forgotten lift. You can’t buy a deadlift … you have to work for it. I constantly read and I am amazed at the Russian’s progress in the deadlift. It started with K K Konstantin Konstantinov and also Oleksandr Kutcher’s 793-pound deadlift at the WPO in Columbus, Ohio, which I had the honor to witness. The Russians have unbelievable athletes and highly intelligent coaches like Askold Surovetsky, Sergey Smolov and A. Kotov. The Russian coach who I have studied the most and have admired the most is Boris Sheiko. Our methods are similar in that we both find ways to increase total volume. Because of Boris, we increased our speed pulls on squat day from the eight to 10 we were doing to 20 lifts. I also suggest you purchase Pavel Tsatsouline’s book Power to the People. To close remember this: you can buy a better bench shirt and you can buy a better squat suit, but you cannot buy a better deadlift. Learn how to start a deadlift. Remember to go to small special exercises after the large barbell special exercises. Examples include rack pulls, next high reps in the Goodmorning, then back raise or reverse hypers, rows and ab work. Twelve hours later more small special exercises, some type of leg curls like glute-ham raises or inverse curls, and then finish with pulling a light sled. Light sled walking can also be a warmup for any upper or lower body workout. Here’s to a better deadlift and the work you’ll be doing to get it. Louie",

      "pageContent": "Raising Volume Louie Simmons Thu Nov 01, 2018 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/RaisVolume_374b8d0b-c42a-490a-b1b6-066ac763b1ed_720x.png?v=1563691640\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" alt=\"Raising Volume\"> Related Topics: Conjugate Method, Exercise Programming, Louie Simmons, Strength Training Methods There are several methods that can be used to raise volume. Raising volume is critical for improving a lift or your total. One method is pharmaceutical products. There is a wide variety of illegal and legal products to choose from. Many can be found at your local GNC vitamin store. But be aware that many of these items are illegal in some federations. It is legal to attain real steroids from your doctor or at an aging clinic, but not to use them in some contests. It seems like a double standard. Westside was competing at a contest and was listening to a doctor talk about how it was not fair to take steroids and compete. One of our lifters saw a patch on the doctor’s shoulder and asked him what it was. He replied, oh that’s a testosterone patch. So everyone has a different view on what is fair and what is not. But, moving on, all methods of nutrition can aid in sports performance. All pharmaceutical products work for some people, but can be expensive and may or may not work for you. You must know your body and what works best for you when it comes to protein and all other supplements. You must determine which one works best for you and what does not work for you. These products can be very expensive, yet not productive for your personal needs.\nA SECOND METHOD IS RESTORATION Ongoing Recovery There are many forms of restoration. The goal of restoration is for some type of recovery. According to Zalessky (1979) there are three main phases of recovery. The first phase is ongoing recovery. For Westside, ongoing recovery is pulling a weight sled with light weight for restoration for a cool down. Always end with the smallest, least stressful exercise, like ankle weight leg curls for 100 to 200 reps or rubber band tri-cep extensions for 100 to 300 reps for recovery of the soft tissue. Ongoing recovery may be listening to music that can calm the athlete down and reduce the heart rate or a self massage and a recovery drink. Everyone needs restoration. The Russians would have a recovery period of sometimes an hour a day.\nRapid Recovery After a workout some would use cryotherapy or a floatation tank, or perhaps some method of massage, baths, saunas, or ice packs. Recovery could be using an I.V. bag to rehydrate. Walking or a swim may be helpful, or a cool-warm shower after a workout. I suggest you read more on the subject. Excellent information can be found in Science of Sports Training by Thomas Kurz (2001); Super training by Mel Siff, Phd (2009); Facts and Fallacies of Fitness by Mel Siff, Phd (date?); and Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. Zatsiorsky and W. Kraemer (2006). DELAYED RECOVERY Westside uses the term delayed transformation. There is a period of training when one must lower the volume and intensity of training to recover from the fatigue, and then realize the work as it becomes a higher level of success at contest time. You can learn more on delayed transformation by reading page 98 of Zatsiorsky and Kraemer’s Science and Practice of Strength Training. In Westside’s recovery system there is a build during the fourth week of the squat pendulum wave. The barbell weight is rolled back to 50 percent plus 25 percent band tension. This allows the volume to be lowered for small recovery. Of course, you may also want to consider non-recovery. To achieve a higher standard of training, a non-recovery three-week wave should be performed to raise your level to a new high. The reward is higher work capacity, fitness, and a greater adaptation for training. Is there another method to raising volume and work capacity? The answer is yes.\nEXTRA WORKOUTS FOR A SPECIFIC NEED For the upperbody , an alternative to nine sets of three reps for speed strength is a high volume method to add muscle mass for a bigger bench. Bill Seno of Chicago gave me a program to increase my bench in 1972. Work up in sets of six reps for six sets and add weight each week for a few weeks until it becomes difficult. Then, reduce the weight and start over with eight sets of eight reps until they become difficult to go higher and then move to10 sets of 10 reps. Again work up for a few weeks until no more progress can be made. Return to six sets of six reps and you find you have made progress with six reps. It will be the same with the eight and 10 rep sets. There should be a large increase in your bench in three or four months. Here’s a tip: use a wide or illegal grip. This is a fool-proof program, especially when lots of triceps extensions are done. This program can raise your bench volume a great deal. Just think, nine sets of three reps at 275 equals 7,425 pounds. Ten sets of 10 reps with 275 equals 27,500 pounds. By adding an all dumbbell workout every forth week, you can add a lot of volume to your program on max effort day. Always do two angles in one workout. Every time you go to the gym do two or three sets of a dumbbell press that you can start with cold. This should be done four times a week. Before squatting do the dumbbell sets. It will work as a warm up no matter what workout you are doing that day. Example: 75-pound dumbbell press for two sets of 20 reps equals 6,000 pounds of extra work by simply using it as your warmup. Alternatives are two sets of barbell benching, one close and one wide. Or you may do two sets of pushups or two sets of dips. You should do only one type of workout at a time. Change to another workout when you feel like you are not getting a stimulus. This may take a toll on you at first, but you will adapt. Consider the two-factor theory (or the fitness-fatigue theory) where a gain in fitness is followed by fatigue. Always finish with the smallest exercise or come back later for a second workout. Large workouts that are extreme in nature in volume or intensity can be done every 72 hours where small workouts can be done every 12 or 24 hours. Now consider what you need for the small workouts that should last 20 to 35 minutes. This workout must be almost non-stop: dumbbell work delt raises, band extensions or what muscles are lagging. Note: do what you need not what you like. Upper body sled work is a good alternative to using standard gym equipment. Remember the correct procedure is that after a compound movement—meaning the five classic lifts plus Goodmornings—go to a small special exercise that will isolate a single muscle group with great resistance where the reps are limited. To finish, go to light exercises where very high repetitions can be accomplished, where up to 100 continuous reps are possible. This will ensure the ligament and tendons are pumped full of blood to strengthen and avoid soft tissue injuries. Now the workout is complete.\nLOWER BODY TRAINING Just like the upper body system, the lower body training starts with the five classical lifts plus large special barbell exercises including the Goodmorning and Zercher lift or Zercher squat. First plan your small special exercises through a priority system. This means train the weakest link first. If it is your lower back after the large special exercise, start with the reverse hyper or back extensions. If you are limited to just a barbell, do Goodmornings. While this article is intended to raise volume, the volume must be distributed correctly. Think of it as a pie. The larges piece of the pie must go to the most neglected body part. After a major barbell exercise only two or three small special exercise are recommended, but the volume must be as high as possible on that day. With that in mind lets move on to the hamstrings. Use a Westside inverse curl machine or a calf-ham-glute bench. Whichever exercise you choose, do as much work as you can on that training day. So far we have covered the lower back and hamstrings. The third special exercise Westside would choose would be some form of exercise on the A.T.P. (Athletic Training Platform). It could be regular belt squats or box squat, belt squat or walking in place for one to three minutes. Other exercises are isometric hold with as heavy a load as possible for one minute. Or deadlifting while belt squatting. For you Olympic lifters, do power cleans, power snatch or push jerk or press. On the A.T.P. we have given you nine exercises to choose from. Abs should always be part of your training. We don't consider abs in the group of special exercise that are rotated, but rather a daily part of training. After all, it all starts with your abs be flexed. The special exercises used above are just one example. There are many combinations from which to rotate: rowing of all types, barbell, dumbbell, two-arm, one-arm, upright row, and cable row. Use your imagination and always start a new exercise when your body or mind stops being stimulated. It is important to get the most out of your training and not let your training get the best of you. Reverse Hypers alone can account for an enormous amount of your volume for lower body training. A 1000-pound squatter will accumulate about 150,000 pounds per week. This is a consecutive amount as it is based on a formula of four times the squat volume at 60 percent on speed strength day. On the two upper body training days, two weights on reverse hypers are lowered, but the reps go up to account for the 50 percent of the upper body days training including max effort day and the dynamic day. The work on the A.T.P. can be very high while both act as a traction device simultaneously. Power walking can add a great deal of volume without any compression on the spine. There are countless ways to use a sled. Forward, backwards, sideways, and pull thru are the major exercises for the lower body. For the upper body and exercises that can be done in the gym do them with a hand strap connected to the sled. And don’t forget the two or three sets of either push ups, dips, dumbbells, or barbell presses. For those who would like to jump 40 times twice a week with some type of resistance, this outline should help construct a program to add volume to your training and at the same time work on restoration to make it possible to reach new training goals. Remember most of the extra work is for small workouts 12 or 24 hours after the main workout. Do not try to add too much extra work inside a regular workout. It cannot be done inside one hour 15 minutes. And pick the correct exercises for your present needs. Louie Simmons References\nSimmons, Louie. 2007. Westside Barbell Book of Methods.

Some can find a way to overcome a training plateau, while others cannot and stop training forever. There are many examples of Westside lifters having a difficult cycle, but then find a way to overcome it and continue to break gym and meet records. The training methods below that have helped our lifters break plateaus may or may not help you go on to break new records, but it should open your mind about training. After accumulating 40 years of training knowledge, Westside has found most of the answers inside our walls, but many lifters and scientists have helped to solve our problems. Here are some of our success stories:\nMastering the Bench Shirt Jay Fry came to Westside to train under George Halbert, a multi-class world record holder. At a meet in Dayton, Ohio, Jay benched 525 pounds at 181 body weight. He showed promise and started to train at Westside. With a 450-pound raw bench, George knew Jay had to learn to use a bench shirt more efficiently, so he trained in a shirt 23 weeks in a row on M-E day. The result was a 700-pound meet bench. Jay went on to break two world records ending with 750 pounds at 181 body weight, which still stands on our record board. After mastering the shirt, he would wear a shirt every three weeks and concentrate on his raw strength.\nDimel Deadlifts The author was going to sumo deadlift at a meet in West Virginia where he was looking for a 700-pound pull. But, hurting his back walking out a squat, he only made his opener at 650 pounds. This put him in a bad mood and after arriving home at 1:30 am, he went out to the gym and loaded 315 pounds on the bar and pulled it for 15 reps. In an effort to punish himself, he pulled 315 for all the reps he could all week long. On Friday he set a new box squat record on a 13-inch box. The box felt high, but it was the same 13-inch box he always used. He measured his upper thigh and it was ¾ of an inch bigger. How? It had to be the high reps in the deadlift. He called Matt Dimel, who had been stuck at 820 pounds for a year, and told him to give it a try. Steve Wilson, who was training with Matt and had an 815-pound deadlift, agreed that they both would give it a try using 225 to 275 pounds for two or three sets of deadlifts of 20 reps four times a week. In nine months Matt made 700 pounds easy. And in 13 months total time, Matt broke the all-time world record with a 1010-pound squat. He could squat the same in sweatpants and the power suit available at the time. At the same time, Steve made an 865 pull at 265-pound body weight. The same deadlifts that put Matt’s name on the world record list gave Steve a 50-pound increase for a meet personal record. The author has named the deadlifts Dimel Deads in honor of him becoming Westside’s first of seven world record holders in the squat. The deadlifts are done on all four major workout days and done as fast as possible in touch-and-go style.\nAn Alternative to Flat Bench Doug Heath, a long-time Westsider, had shoulder pain starting in 1975 while benching on a flat bench. It persisted continuously, so Doug would only do mild incline and decline presses. Gary Drago, a power-house 220-pounder, would do the same and had a 550 raw bench. After Doug became accustomed to the mild angles, his flat bench began to soar to the point that Doug broke the 132-pound class world record at 405 pounds. This shows that there are many ways to overcome a plateau. I recall two powerlifters from Pittsburgh using the same system and both could bench 500 pounds in the late 1960s.\nRaising Volume Greg Panora came to Westside with a 2250 total. I saw the unlimited potential he had, and in one year he broke his first world record total doing 2565 at 242 body weight. The key to Greg’s progress was to raise his bench volume. As you know, speed strength day calls for 9x3 reps between contests. Greg would do 9x6 reps—double the volume. Plus, Greg would wear 10-pound ankle weights on his waist to make benching more difficult. Today, you see Greg benching 570 raw without a handout. A secret weapon was his training partners such as Luke Edwards who would battle it out every day, never giving an inch. Two things made Greg a multi-world-record holder—physical work and a strong mental attitude.\nBuilding the Bench Lockout George Halpert waited two years to show up at Westside. I asked him why it took so long. His reply? He thought we were dangerous and crazy. He came with a two-year-old 475-pound bench press, but after walking in the door at Westside, he made 628 in less than a year. George was very explosive; always doing ballistic benching—dropping the bench as fast as possible then stopping it one- to one-and-a-half inches off his chest and blasting it to lockout. But now, he was having lockout trouble. His training partner Kenny Patterson had built 23 ½-inch arms on a 5’6” frame and could lockout anything that was on the bar. George knew he had to build a lockout like Kenny’s. What was the plan? First, he did dumbbell extensions as heavy as possible, roll back with 110-pound dumbbells off the floor, incline, decline, and also seated French-press style. George pushed up the JM presses and included a lot of close-grip step-incline presses. There were also lots of pin presses with heavy band tension—up to 350 pounds of band tension—plus weight; and lots of elbow out to the side extensions. It started to happen. George had a strong lockout to go with the speed. He began to break all-time world records—not in just one weight class, but in three. I recall a money bench meet in Daytona and The Great Dave Waterman, the current world record holder at 198 body weight with 632, was there. As George opened up with 633 and went on to bench 678 to cap off a three world-record rampage, Dave said to the author, “I got some competition now.” Yes, Dave, you certainly do.\nBreaking World Record Squats Phil Harrington first called Westside for help on his deadlift. It was low at 560 pounds for a 181-pounder. The solution was Goodmornings. Never having done a single Goodmorning, Phil’s deadlift shot up to 620 pounds very fast once he started this work. Phil was convinced of the Westside Methods and moved to Columbus, Ohio, to train with the gang. We noticed Phil squatted fairly close when he broke his teammate Arnold Coleman’s 181 record of 854 with a half kilo 856 pounds. First Phil was taught how to box squat correctly and move out his stance. By doing wide box squats, he went on a record-breaking spree that ended up at 903 with a 680 deadlift, a 120-pound improvement in the deadlift. Phil had reached a double plateau in the squat and deadlift, but Goodmornings for a stronger back and wide box squats to build his hip strength, left Phil a lifting legacy at Westside he can be proud of forever.\nVlad Alhazov Vlad came to Westside wanting to squat 1100 pounds and deadlift 800 pounds. He had position problems in the squat and deadlift. Like Phil Harrington, the Goodmorning would be the special barbell exercise that would make the difference for Vlad. Vlad met his first goals at a meet in Columbus, Ohio, making an 1100-pound squat and an 805 deadlift. Vlad pushed the Goodmornings working up to 865x3 reps, then, his new ultimate goals were a 1200-pound squat and a 900-pound deadlift. The Goodmornings along with lots of Reverse Hypers and extensive hamstring work made it possible to squat a world record 1250 pounds along with a 925-pound deadlift to total 2805 pounds. Nowadays Vlad concentrates on his raw squat making a mind-blowing 1113-pound squat for the raw world record. His back strength is unbelievable due to the Goodmornings—almost a forgotten exercise, but take Phil’s and Vlad’s word on it, they work.\nAccommodating Resistance (AC) Chuck Vogelpohl, a long-time Westside lifter who won his first National in 1987, was strong from the start, especially in the back and hips, but he had to overcome two plateaus. One of his plateaus was a sticking point near to the top of the squat. One reason he was having a problem was that he needed to gain more size on his legs. Westside had begun an 18-month experiment with using chains for AC. After three meets, the conclusion was that the chains had a very positive effect on the concentric phase of the lift. About 25 percent of the load was made up of chain weight and 50 percent to 60 percent was with the barbell. The result was a large number of new records being set at Westside. Because the chain would unload on the eccentric phase, no gain in muscle mass was noted nor was there a faster reversible phase. Dave Williams of Liberty University asked Westside to do an experiment with strong rubber bands by a company called Jump Stretch, owned by Dick Hartzel. The bands were mostly used for stretching and conditioning. By placing the bands on the barbell, they gave a more even displacement over the entire range of motion. Two things became apparent: first, there was an overspeed eccentric phase due to the bands pulling you downward due to the elastic properties of the rubber itself and second, it caused an increase in muscle mass. Eccentric muscle action involves high force development. Most injuries happen on the eccentric phase, but highly trained athletes can sustain these forces. These two factors build tremendous reversible muscular action. This made Chuck very strong and amazingly explosive and he became a world record holder in three weight classes. Using heavy bands on his squats and deadlifts helped Chuck break through his training plateaus.\nSpeed Strength Training Wes McCormack came to Westside with an 800-pound squat, a 515-pound bench, and a 560-pound deadlift to total 1880 at 165 body weight. One type of special strength changed Wes forever. It was adding speed strength to his program. The result? In one year Wes totaled 2020 pounds with a world record 890-pound squat, a 585-pound bench, and 605 deadlift. Nowadays, Wes has made a 900-pound squat, a 615-pound bench press, and a 620 deadlift. His total now is 2120, second only to Oleksandr Kutcher from the Ukraine. The key for Wes was to add three-week pendulum waves on Fridays at 50, 55 and 60 percent for 25 total squats and 25 total deadlifts. It was with 25 percent band tension. Eighty percent of his training is made up of small special exercises to raise his weak muscle group. Now that Wes has found his weakness, he works on his speed continuously along with his flexibility. It would be an honor to break Oleksandr’s total record and put it on the wall at Westside forever. Special strength plays a great role in strength training, but it is important to know what you need and, more important, to train it.\nBalanced training Rob “Fuzz dog” Fusner came to Westside with zero experience in powerlifting. In his first meet he did not know what lift was first. I could not believe anyone could not know how a power meet was run. Well, Fusdog made an elite total at his very first meet. He caught on fast. All three lifts began going up, but his bench was really moving up fast. The IPA National in York was Fusdog’s first big meet. Dave Barno, a power house 308-pounder was lifting. Dave is gone now, but he was a good friend. A short story about Dave: when lifting at the APE Nationals in Chicago he passed out doing a heavy deadlift. He hit his head hard on the floor. I ran over to help him up once he came to. He looks me in the eye and says, “What happened, Mom?” It was really funny at the time … back to York. It came down to the deadlift and Dave could pull well into the eight hundreds. We called for an 820-pound deadlift on Fusdog’s third attempt to force Dave into an 865-pound deadlift, but changed the third to a makeable 770 pounds. Dave or his helpers did not realize we made the change and he was left to make a personal record. He missed. He came up to me after the meet and said, “You got me, mother f__.” We laughed, and he said, “See you at the next meet.” But, unfortunately, he passed on. Dave may be gone, but not forgotten. This was good experience for Fusdog. The next meet was a money bench press meet in Daytona where all the great benchers would compete. A young Ryan Kennelly was at the meet to compete against Fusdog and later told me he thought he could psych out our lifters. But they could not be psyched out. Ryan bombed out and Fusdog broke the 308-pound world record for his first world record. Fusdog broke mental plateaus by lifting against the world’s best. He had to retire early due to personal obligations and Ryan went on to become one of the greatest—if not the greatest—bench presser of all time breaking all-time world records and ending with a mind-blowing 1075.\nStrength Work for the Squat and Bench A.J. Roberts came to Westside with a 2400-pound total and a 715-pound bench. He retired with a 2855 and best lifts of 2930 in three short years. He had to work through plateaus in the squat and bench. Here is how it was accomplished. For the squat, the proven method of two strength cycles lasting two weeks was done and two circa max cycles were done in a yearly plan. The first strength speed cycle A. J. and Jake Anderson trained with were 700 pounds of band tension plus bar weight. Week 1 they used 430x3 sets of two reps. Jake was somewhat faster. Week 2 they maxed out with Jake making 700-pound band and 460-pound weight that equaled 1160 at top. A. J. made 700-pound band and 510-pound weight that equaled 1210 pounds at the top. On circa max, Jake made 700-pound bar weight and 440-pound band tension that equaled 1140 pounds at the top. At the meet Jake made an 1135-pound meet personal record. A. J. made 740-pound bar weight and 440-pound band tension that equaled 1180 pounds at the top. At the meet A. J. made a 1205-pound squat. The four workouts during the year raised A. J.‘s squat strength up to become Westside’s third 1200-pound plus squatter. The combination of bands and bar weight must be calculated correctly to produce world records. J.’s bench was going no where the first year at Westside. We told him he had to do triceps extensions. He said they hurt his elbows and we said it hurt because the tendons and ligaments must be conditioned to withstand the work needed to push a big bench. A. J. pushed them hard and as a result, his bench shot up almost 200 pounds to 915 pounds. The bench made it possible for him to break the world 308-pound total record three times while at Westside. You must know what to work on to improve. Remember, it does no good to be strong in the wrong exercise.\nMental and Physical Plateaus Most new to Westside are now accustomed to the high volume at Westside on speed strength days. Twenty-five squats and 25 deadlifts can add up to 23,000 pounds of squats and at least 15,000 pounds of deadlifts for a 1000-pound squat. Plus, 80 percent of the training is on small special exercises. If you want to be a real champion, you must be able to handle larger and larger volumes throughout the multi-year training. But not only larger and larger volume, you also must correctly select the current special exercise. This requires many workouts a week, not just four. The GPP must closely match SPP for your sport. And what about your mental approach? The author was instructed to read Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a spiritual self-help book about a seagull who wanted to fly as fast as possible. He was looked down upon from the elder seagulls for flying fast was not the job a seagull was intended to do. They kicked Jonathan out of the flock for good. Now, however, he could try to break his speed records whenever he wanted to. But soon he thought there must be limits to how fast a seagull could fly. One day on the beach Jonathan saw a silver seagull about 100 yards away. Then, in a flash, it was at his side. Jonathan said in amazement, “How did you do that?” The elder seagull said, “Perfect speed.” Jonathan asked, “What is perfect speed?” The elder seagull named Chang answered, “Perfect speed is being there.” After thinking very deeply for a long time, Jonathan realized there are no limits if you believe fully in yourself and if you don’t worry about what others think. This small book did big things for the author and he still has the original copy in his cabinet today. So you see there are really no plateaus to overcome … just small delays.\nLouie Simmons Read more:How to start a deadlift",

Jumping also can play a large role in powerlifting and especially Olympic lifting, mostly for the jerk phase. Jumping is about explosive power, but what is explosive power? According to the definition by Tidow (1990), explosive power, or strength, is the ability to rapidly increase force—the steeper the increase of strength in time, the greater the explosive strength.\nTrain All Three Strengths Simultaneously Explosive strength is trained at fast velocity, but to fully exploit explosive strength, the other two velocities must be simultaneously trained with jumping while explosive strength is trained with the barbell at mostly 30 to 40 percent in three-week waves. Speed strength is trained most efficiently at 75 to 85 percent in three-week waves repeated throughout the year. It is trained at intermediate velocity. To develop strength speed or slow strength, one must lift the maximal weight possible on Max-Effort (M-E) day meaning completing an all-time record mostly on a special large barbell exercise. It is trained at slow velocity. This method of max effort is implemented by the Russians and Westside Barbell. The Bulgarian method calls for measuring a day-by-day max.\nSo how do you build jumping power? For weight training there must be two training days for the lower and upper body. One for maximal strength and one for speed strength.\nWhat is the max effort and why do you need it? M-E is lifting a maximal load against maximal resistance. It is superior for improving both intramuscular and inter-muscular coordination. Your muscle and your central nervous system (CNS) adapt only to the loads placed on them. M-E workouts use movements from the list below or some combination. Work up to a one rep: Rack pulls\nBox pulls\nPower clean\nPower snatch\nPush jerk\nPress\nBench press\nRack squat\nFront squat\nBelt squat\nIncline\nDecline\nFloor press Perform some M-E workouts with or without accommodating resistance. As weights grow larger they slow down. This is due to the relationship between force and velocity. Lift only heavy weights and you slow down.\nTo counteract the second workout for speed strength, it must be trained 72 hours later. While M-E calls for working up to a one rep max causing the barbell volume to be low, the speed strength day calls for 18 lifts for pulls, and 18 lifts and presses for squats in the 70 percent range. At 80 percent, you’ll need to do 15 lifts for pulls, squats or presses; two to five reps per set.\nPeriodization According to A. S. Prilepin’s data (1974), the speed strength training is used for building a fast rate of development. Lifting only maximal weights in slow velocity does not ensure increasing your rate of force development. This means both must be trained in the same weekly plan. For more on periodization read Special Strength Development for All Sports by Louie Simmons (2015). Always use the largest barbell exercises and work down to small special exercises and on to bands or cables.\nBuilding Jumping Power Now, to build jumping power, there must be two methods of jumping. The first is jumping up with resistance of many types. The second is a shock method depth jumping where one drops from a predetermined height. Before we start jumping onto or off of boxes, let’s do basic general exercises such as kneeling jumps for hip development. First, do seated-on-floor pressing and curling to condition the body for kneeling jumps. Then, jump off knees onto feet. Now start with a barbell across your shoulders. Next are kneeling cleans, kneeling snatches with feet square, then split snatches. Pick one for a warmup for box or depth jumps. Use any order you wish. Westside’s record with bar-on-back to feet is 310 pounds. Do only 20 kneeling jumps for warmup next.\nBox Jumps with Resistance Use ankle weights of five to 20 pounds, a weight vest from 20 to 100 pounds, Kettlebells from four kilograms to 32 kilograms or any combination you like—for example, ankle weights plus Kettlebells. Do 40 jumps two times a week. Establish a record, and then check for new records about every three or four weeks. Keep accurate records for every combination. There will be a lot to monitor. There are several methods to approach the box. One is to sit on a lower box—like a box squat—and then jump up to a second higher box. Jumping with body weight can cause a faster increase of strength in time producing a greater amount of explosive strength. To jump you must possess the correct body type, strength, speed and application of elasticity of the muscles that take part in the take off. Much more information can be found in Explosive Power and Jumping Ability by Tadeusz Starzynski (1999). Before going on, you must know that general jumping has no ill effect on timing, coordination, or technique. All so, to build general jumping ability, jump down then back up to same height boxes.\nDepth Jumps Shock Training For building eccentric actions, jump from a high box down and up to a lower box. For building concentric actions, drop off a short box and jump onto a higher box. For all depth jumps, the amortization phase must be as short as possible. The depth jump is the last phase of jumping. Depth jumps are used for explosive strength and reactive ability when you are using depth jumps from a box roughly 24 inches and no higher than 30 inches. Dropping off higher boxes will produce an increase in maximal strength due to the fact that the amortization phase is longer than a plyometric action that must be no more than 0.15 seconds between eccentric and concentric contractions. Although a study by Wilson (1990) showed that some amount of stored energy is retained up to four seconds, it is not a plyometric action as some stored energy is used for reversal strength. The author finds by box squatting correctly reversal strength can be retained up to eight seconds. To perform a depth jump as Y. Verkhoshansky suggests, the athlete takes a step forward with one leg and at the top of the fall brings the other leg forward, which brings the two legs together. The legs must not bend before stepping off the box or platform. Do not jump, but drop forward. Next, the athlete must land on both legs on the balls of the feet and then quickly lean back on the heels. The landing should be relaxed and flexible, then cushion, and then to an immediate take off. This cushioning is the amortization phase and must be as brief as possible. The take-off phase goal is to jump onto the highest box possible or to reach up and touch the highest point attainable with one or two hands. It could be a point on the wall or a ball or flag that can be raised or lowered for each athlete. After jump, land as soft as possible on balls of feet. Depth jumps can be very stressful on the CNS as well as the lower extremities. Do not perform depth jumps when tired or suffering an injury. Beginners should limit depth jumps to 24 two times a week. The advanced can perform 40 jumps two times a week. A rule for any depth jumps is to be able to full squat two times body weight to endure the stress of the landing.\nWhat is the process of a depth jump? As the athlete falls through space at 9.8 m/s, the speed of acceleration of gravity near Earth, the athlete has potential energy. As the athlete lands, he or she produces kinetic energy. K-E depends on the athlete’s weight and speed. Upon landing, the depth jump will produce elastic energy equal to the K-E of the athlete at the end of the fall. Upon landing, the shorter the braking time or the amortization phase from eccentric to concentric phase, the greater the muscular force for the take-off phase. Before depth jumps: Always warm up\nDo not use depth jumps when injured\nThe amortization must be as short as possible under two-tenths of a second\nNo more than five to eight depth jumps per set; no more than 24 per workout for novices; no more than 40 per workout for top athletes\nConcentrate on reversible strength on landing before raising box height\nUse adequate rest periods when doing any jumping.

They're leading the way with improvements to delivery of Nitrogren gas, consumption rates of Nitrogen gas, and improved safety features, and affordiblity. Their units are built to move to fit through standard 36\" doorways so they are easy to move. Some more details of their units are as follows:\nImproved Nitrogen gas consumption rate\nTheir world renown engineering team has designed advanced features that improve the consumption rate of Nitrogen gas. These technological innovations in the conversion process have proved 20% more efficient in their initial benchmark comparisons to comparable units on the market.\nCryoFlow Air Circulation\nTheir patent-pending design features unique release valves that insure even and safe distribution across the entire body. It incorporates several air flow dividers that prevent contact with the liquid Nitrogen gas during the session.\nTemperature ranges from -45ºF to -225ºF\nThis allows you to provide exact treatment to each client to give them the comfort they need. Their digital interface makes recreating custom temperatures for clients easy and precise. Cryotherapy has many benefits to all ranges of people that include improving mood to relieving pain. What happens during a session is that Nitrogen gas is pumped out to cool the skin to about 30ºF to 50ºF in three minutes. This causes the skin to send thermoreceptors to the brain to send the blood to the core to maintain body temperature with a process called vasoconstriction. This process flushes toxins from peripheral tissues and blood is enriched with oxygen, enzymes, and nutrients. Along with this the body releases endorphins. A few of the other benefits from cryotherapy would be:\nDecreases Inflammation and Pain\nCryotherapy reduces inflammation throughout the entire body. The process triggers anti-inflammatory norepinephrine release that reduces short-term pain from injuries. This also helps speed up the natural recovery of the body to help repair damage from working out or an injury. Boosts the Immune System\nDuring a cryotherapy session your body increases white blood cells and immune cells. Reduced anxiety and stress levels while increasing energy and capacity for exercise\nAlong with the benefits of pain relief, cryotherapy also improves mood while relieving stress. During a session your body releases endorphins into the bloodstream and these endorphins interact with pain receptors, reducing pain perception. While this is taking place your Cortisol levels are being reduced causing a happier mood.\nIncreased Metabolism\nYour body works to increase your internal temperature through various methods that in turn cause you to burn between 500 to 800 calories. There isn't much upkeep involved with owning your own cryotherapy unit. Cryoxcel units are made to last with performance stainless steel. Their interface is easy to use and it can be updated from anywhere wirelessly. Custom logos for your buisness can also be added to make your unit more unique. The unit becomes a valuable asset with an average of one person a day paying for 90% of the cost of the machine. There are many options for sessions to provide to your clients with walk-ins, a package deal of multiple sessions at a reduced rate per session, or paying monthly to use the machine an unlimited amount of times for the month.

Louie Simmons Mon Jan 28, 2019 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/GPP2019_9e4238b7-a6f1-4f20-aa94-668939743260_720x.png?v=1563691310\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" alt=\"What is General Physical Preparation?\"> Related Topics: Conjugate Method, Exercise Programming, Louie Simmons, Strength Training Methods What is General Physical Preparation (GPP)? GPP is first used to raise your level of physical fitness, but it must be directed toward your particular sport. When many people think of being physically fit, CrossFit crosses our minds. While CrossFit’s training goal is to bring a person to a high level of physical fitness, their training also is aimed at the person competing in the CrossFit games where the winners are incredibly fit.\nBut, because CrossFit has so many different sports activities, the training is non directed fitness. This simply means there is no component of Specialized Physical Preparation (SPP) that would be needed to compete at the highest level of an Olympic sport such as the high jump, Judo, or weight lifting. Westside advocates the same theory held by Boudarchuk (1979) that GPP and SPP must be basically interchangeable. The great Bulgarian weightlifters of the 1980s did only SPP and no GPP due to the amazing amount of daily maxes they performed—4,000 per year compared to 600 all-time maxes that Westside and the Russians calculate in a yearly plan. Now that we know CrossFit training is perfect for CrossFit, it is not to be used for any individual sport due to the fact it has no SPP for your sport. GPP will bring a balanced plan to build your strength, speed, special endurance mobility, dexterity and flexibility. But it this sounds like CrossFit training, it is not. There are some elements that must be trained for your sport while other would be a waste of training time. Let’s look at the training at Westside for powerlifting. The powerlifter must maintain a degree of mobility and flexibility. Too much mobility and flexibility, however, can have an adverse effect on lifting. Consider the training of a contortionist: they train for an incredible amount of flexibility, but this can lead to difficulty in building adequate strength to support a partner for their most strenuous routines. The powerlifter or weight lifter must concern themselves with lifting a high volume of barbell lifts and working down to smaller special exercises until bands or cables finish the workout. Sled work is common at Westside, but only short trips of 60 meters are performed. The same for wheelbarrow walking, much like sprinting, short trips with the weight sled or wheelbarrow. Powerlifters use heavy weights on one day like squats, deadlifts and heavy belt squatting. It would do no good to pull a weight sled for a long distance—like three minutes or longer. Longer pulls would work for 1500 meters or a mile runner. Gaining muscle mass or losing body fat can be the role of your GPP training. There are athletes who need to gain muscle mass. For most people, Westside prefers to build muscle around a weak joint. It could be elbows, low back, neck, hips or knees. There is a saying at Westside, “Big ain’t strong; strong is strong.” You don’t have to gain weight to become strong. Some small men are stronger than their larger counterparts. It also does no good to carry extra body fat. Extra body fat just makes it more difficult to overcome the force of gravity while jumping or running. GPP can start with cycling, jogging, swimming, or playing ball sports. Remember GPP and SPP should closely resemble each other. The powerlifting at Westside is practically indistinguishable between GPP and SPP. No regular squats, no regular deadlifts, a bench shirt is worn once a month, and a true max raw is done about once every six weeks. And, yet, within a 15-mile radius of Westside, 14 men have broken all-time world records. This shows that our GPP training has a high rate of trainability toward our specific powerlifting goal. It does no good to be strong in the wrong exercises. The powerlifter must have a high degree of maximal strength, speed and add muscle mass where it is needed. GPP can raise the reliability of technique by not reducing small special exercises close to meet time. It is important that your GPP training be specific to your sport. It can range from raising maximal strength to elevating your VO2 max or even working on reaction time. Let’s look at GPP for some individual sports.\nOlympic-Style Weight Lifting For the advanced lifter, a minimum of 50 percent of the training should include special exercises: high pulls, Goodmornings, shrugs, back raises, belt squats, reverse hypers, calves-ham-glutes, inverse curls, jumping, and power sled walking. This does not cover all GPP work, but just a sample.\nThrower’s Guide to GPP A thrower should include weight training for all special strengths—explosive, speed and strength speed; jumps and bounding of all types; some simple gymnastics; Kettlebells work; throwing and catching medicine balls of different weights; rope climbing or hanging by one hand; short sprints; weight sled work; throwing shots of different weights; throwing hammers of different weights and sand bags for the javelin; club throwing; hammer throws with short and longer chains; rotating in both directions to eliminate muscle imbalances; throwing discus of different weights; training on special weight machines to correct single-joint weakness; increasing running speed for the javelin; and training on special machines for improving velocity. Once more, this is just a partial list for throwers.\nGPP for the Track Athlete Having worked with Olympic sprinters including two Gold Medal winners, a Silver Medalist in the long jump, and numerous collegiate sprinters, this advice comes with much experience.\nLike most sports, a track athlete should go through one period of accumulation at the start of their track training. After that, they should have combined periods of intensification that lead to the period of transformation after which the training should join GPP and SPP as closely as possible.\nNo more blocks, but rather using three-week waves during the season that would use mostly SPP and GPP to maintain a solid foundation of training to avoid lose of physical strength and fitness. During the off season with no competitions they should use a set of tests to evaluate continued sports growth, testing sprints from 10 to 50 meters or special jumps.\nIf one does not constantly improve strength and power, sprint times will suffer. It is easy to raise strength and power while perfecting running technique. What I have found more alarming is the high amount of muscle imbalance or bilateral deficits in the lower body.\nCalves, hamstrings, glutes and hips must possess equal strength in both limbs. Sports like weight lifting and powerlifting do not have a bilateral deficit due to using either legs or arms with barbell training. Dumbbells must be used for throwers due to using one arm at a time in their events.\nOn the other hand, runners have many bilateral deficits. The force produced with one limb is less than half the force produced using unilateral movements. A top sprinter produces 1000 pounds per step. For example, if you can bench press 400 pounds with a barbell, you can not come close to pressing two 200-pound dumbbells.\nHaving worked with many top sprinters and longer-distance runners, many are injured by having a bilateral deficit or muscle imbalance from one muscle group to another muscle group. The GPP here is partly fixing the muscle imbalances or bilateral deficits. Westside has a hamstring machine called the Inverse Curl. It measures hamstring strength, bilateral deficits or your unilateral strength.\nBy using less weight on the machine, it can show an increase in your hamstring strength until you eventually can do a Russian Leg Curl. This is where your training partner holds your ankles while you lower yourself face down to the floor at a slow steady rate, then return to the starting point kneeling on your knees. Westside has lifters and sprinters holding up to 45 pounds on their chests while doing a Russian Leg Curl. If there is a three or four percent bilateral deficit in one leg, it can cause injury. This deficit also happens with the glutes or hips and can cause one to distort his or her running form. Strong hamstrings are a key to fast sprinting. Westside had a former world-class sprinter turned world-record holder in the squat. Her hamstring-quad ratio was 60 percent hamstring, 40 percent quad. This is the highest ever recorded at the Ohio State University. She performed all types of hamstring exercises from calf-ham-glute raises to standing one-leg curls to the smallest special hamstring exercises with a cable or rubbers bands and ankle weights. A major special exercise is reverse hypers. Why are they so important? The key to faster running is hip extensions. The Reverse HyperTM is very effective for building the area of the hamstrings that tie into the glutes.\nCharlie Francis said the ratio of power output of the hip extension to ankle flexion is 7 to 1, hip to knee. If you have a bilateral deficit in the glutes, simply start the concentric action on the Reverse Hyper with the lagging glute. This will solve the problem. Also you can use leg lifts, single-leg box jumping, and single-leg jumping on a plyo-swing.\nThe definition of a sprint is to run as fast as possible for a short distance. This means the sprinter needs to accelerate as long as possible. The sprinter’s GPP must resemble SPP. What makes up a 100-meter sprint? According to the book The Rocket Sprint Start by Bud Winter and Jim Son Lee, the breakdown for the top 100-meter sprinters is 64 percent acceleration and 18 percent top maximum velocity, which leaves 12 percent for some deceleration.\nThis is SPP. The sprinter’s GPP training should be broken down to the same percentage for each stage of the race. Work on strength and power roughly 64 percent of the training. Work on strength endurance 18 percent of the training with barbell, squats and deadlifts for 20 seconds or more per set. No need to work on deceleration—that is how to lose a race.\nAfter building a base, only work on the first two and most important phases of sprinting. Coaches need to analyze the sport closely. Do not have the sprinter run a mile if his or her races are sprints. If you have the sprinter run longer distances you are working the wrong energy systems and will only be teaching them to conserve their muscular force production.\nA friend of mine who worked with a top female 400 meter sprinter had her main focus be acceleration by doing 10 40-meter sprints. This is SPP. Her GPP training consisted of deadlifts for 30 seconds a set and having her try to add reps to the second and third sets. A fast eccentric phase will cause no additional body weight to be added.\nRemember, it does no good to practice exercises that don’t apply to your sport or event, or as A.Bondarchuk explains in his book Transfer of Exercise, GPP and SPP must blend closely together for you to exceed at gaining sports excellence.\nCoaching is indeed a tough occupation. It calls for a coach to read countless books and articles to specialize in single events for track and not generalize. The coach must also learn how to perform strength exercises correctly. To perform them incorrectly will lead to certain injury.\nLouie References\nBondarchuk, A. P. Transfer of Training in Sports II. Michigan: Ultimate Athletic Concepts, (2010).\nKurz, T.

It would start a training cycle with light weights ranging up to 20 reps for muscle mass, and then use medium weights for speed strength. At this point the reps were reduced to ensure building power to make it possible to enter into heavy M-E training close to a meet. This system had many flaws when going through one phase to another. The first phase for building muscle mass should include 80 percent of the training with small, single-joint exercises to ensure correct muscle balance. When moving on to the medium weights to build strength speed the reps are reduced as well as total work volume as intensity grows. Now as you move on to heavyweights, fewer reps lead to less volume. In fact, at this point, you have reduced the volume to such an extent it is very hit or miss on contest day. Also, as you leave the lightweights cycle, which normally lasts six weeks, and move on to the medium weights, you lose much of the muscle mass that you have spent six weeks building. Then, after six weeks of medium weights for speed strength, you move on to the heavyweights competitive period, but then you start to lose your speed strength. Now you have to reduce your reps to complete the competitive period to complete the training up to the meet. Westside knows how much volume it takes to squat 600 or 800 pounds. You need to train at an average of 80 percent of the amount you want to squat. For a 600-pound squat, you would train at 80 percent of 600 pounds (480 pounds) times 25 reps, which is a volume of 12,000 pounds. (The calculation is .80 x 600 x 25.) For an 800-pound squat, you would train at 80 percent of 800 pounds (640 pounds) times 25 reps, which is a volume of 16,000 pounds. (The calculation is .80x800x25.) But when using the Progressive Overload System, this is never the case. Using it can lead to two things: injury or not reaching your meet goal. But, if you reach your new goal at meet time, you start a new hypothetical goal. Plus, you start over with the same old light weights for high reps. Thank about this: If you climb Mount Everest half way up you start a base camp.\nYou don’t go back down the mountain and start over the next day just to reach the half-way point again. But this is precisely what you are doing when using the Progressive Overload Principle of organizing your training. This type of training does not ensure over or under training due to dropping the important small special exercises that made it possible to reach new goals. The theory of dividing training into three separate cycles was presented by Nikolay Ozolin in the text Training the Athlete, Moscow, but that was 1949, and it is 2018 now. Western Periodization, designed by Matveyev, was looked on as the superior method of periodization, but many Russian sports scientists found flaws in its structure, many of which I have discussed. One critic was Verkhosansky, who stated that the Western Periodization Model was made for weightlifting, track and field, and swimming.\nThe main emphasis was on volume and intensity zones. Many use three volumes—low, medium and high—along with high medium or low intensity. Experts like Vorobyen, 1978, and Ermakov, 1974, worked on the calculation for total volume and at a certain intensity zone.\nWestside Wave Periodization The Westside model was designed using the data of great Russian sports scientists. Two of them—A. D. Ermakov and N. S. Atanasov—showed data in 1975 of the selection of training loads in 780 cases of their highly skilled weightlifters. Weights ranging from 55 percent to 100 percent in these cases determined that 50 p0ercent of all barbell training was from 75 percent to 85 percent. This laid the foundation for our speed strength day for both upper and lower body workouts. The third great Russian sport scientist, and also a Jr. and Sr. weightlifting coach, A. S. Prilepin had gathered data in 1974 concerning the minimal, optimal and maximal number of reps in a single set and the total number of lifts per workout with a barbell. And, last, but not least, Arosiev’s approach to the pendulum wave training has completed the puzzle that has produced the greatest male and female powerlifters of all time: Dave Hoff, with a 3014-pound total at 308 body weight, and Heidi Howar with a 1500-pound total at 132 body weight. Everything is based on math and bar velocity. For speed strength, the bar velocity is roughly .08 m/s. All highly skilled powerlifters should be able to obtain the .08 m/s stated above. As your strength grows, so must your base strength level. If you make a 500-pound squat at your last contest, you should not fall below 90 percent (or 450 pounds) of that mark.\nThe loading below is based on your barbell weight. If you use combinations of resistance methods training with rubber bands, use a combination of 50 percent, 55 percent, or 60 percent bar weight, plus 25 percent band tension at lockout. The combination of bar weight and band tension is best to ensure Compensatory Acceleration Training, or C.A.T. This prevents the barbell velocity to slow as you lockout at the top. This causes an increase in muscle tension by trying to maintain top speed throughout the entire lift. Dr. Fred Hatfield said no one can lift a heavy weight slow. This is directly in line with the force velocity relationship: motion velocity decreases as external resistance (load) increases. Maximum force (Fmm) is attained when velocity is small and then things reverse. When maximum velocity (Vmm) is attained when external resistance is close to zero. Different velocities provide separate special strengths: Fast velocity=Explosive strength\nIntermediate velocity=Speed strength\nSlow velocity=Strength speed This is the result of the hyperbolic equation known as Hill’s Equation, named after A. V. Hill, 1938. The Westside pendulum wave is repeated indefinitely every fourth week to maintain a set amount of strength for a team sport. For rugby it could be maintaining a 500-pound squat year-long. Just use the three-week wave for a 500-pound lift. Remember after a meet you must never drop below 90 percent of your best lifts or you must workout to raise your level of preparedness to begin training again. Only students take vacations, not athletes. There cannot be any guesswork, but base the training on your best lift. The special exercises, small and large, on both speed strength and M-E days will cause a rise in your strength. Start the training over at close to 90 percent of your new contest maximum. Study the chart at the end of this article closely and you will see that as your volume goes up so do your lifts with the correct bar speed. And that will happen while you’re working on your single-joint deficiencies, and while you’re constantly working on your lifting technique and selecting the correct exercises on your small workouts. If you stay with the correct percentages and total volume, an 800-pound squatter will move his 80 percent just as fast as a 400-pound squatter. After a meet, start your cycle at 100 pounds less than your new meet squat record. After a three-week wave, start the second three-week wave equal to your new record. Every fourth week change the bar you start with and repeat. This holds true for the bench by changing bars or switching from chains to bands or a combination of both. The speed pulls will change from standing on a two-inch or four-inch box to placing the plates on two-inch or four-inch mat rack pull on multiple pins and so forth. By using a three-week wave, you gradually become stronger year in and year out while raising volume slowly, but continuously, throughout your career. It makes no sense to take time off and start at the bottom of the mountain again only to build your self back up to old standards. With speed strength day it is a gradual wave, while M-E workouts have a very steep wave as they change each week. If you want constant progress, try wave periodization. Look at the chart carefully.\nLouie Simmons Max Squat 400 Reps Sets Total Reps Total Volume Week 1_75% = 300 2 12 24 7200 Week 2_80% = 320 2 12 24 7680 Week 3_85% = 340 2 10 20 6800 500 Week 1_75% = 375 2 12 24 9000 Week 2_80% = 400 2 12 24 9600 Week 3_85% = 425 2 10 20 8500 600 Week 1_75% = 450 2 12 24 10,800 Week 2_80% = 480 2 12 24 11,520 Week 3_85% = 510 2 10 20 10,200 700 Week 1_75% = 525 2 12 24 12,600 Week 2_80% = 560 2 12 24 13,440 Week 3_85% = 595 2 10 20 11,900 800 Week 1_75% = 600 2 12 24 14,400 Week 2_80% = 640 2 12 24 15,360 Week 3_85% = 680 2 10 20 13,600",

Pat Casey used the power rack to become the first 600-pound bencher. He also used rack lockout for an 800-pound squat. Pat was the first man to do it along with a 2,000-pound total. Lifters have sticking points at different points of their bench. The floor press will show you where your sticking point is when you lie on the floor with your triceps resting on the floor with a barbell in your hands. It will determine your sticking point. But, any part of the bench can be trained by placing a set of pins in your rack. I had no training partner in the early 1970s and used the power rack almost all the time. For the positions just off the chest, two-inches off the chest and midpoint, I would lower the bar to the pins, relax my arms, and then press to lockout. I would start with the maximum, wide grip for sets of a max. Then, I would start over with an index finger touching the smooth part of the bar. No back arch and no body heave. This can be a major problem while benching off boards. You must keep records for each pin and for both grips. Pressing off pins from a dead start eliminates any momentum, which means no cheating. By using three or four pin settings, you will hit all angles of the bench press. Always press up in a straight line or somewhat toward the feet. This is the shortest path to lockout and is the safest method. Culver City Westside lifter Bill Thurber and the famous Jim Williams, who made 675 in the 1972 Worlds, also pressed in the same fashion. Williams and the West gang were my main mentors, but it’s ironic that East German throwers also benched in this manner. I found instant progress from doing high pin lockouts. Pressing off pins at a level where I would take the bar out of a regular bench or maybe one or two inches below. This called for just pressing on the pins concentrically first. Today, with lifters using bench shirts that can give you 300 pounds and more, there is no weight used between their raw max and a shirt max. But, by doing high pin lockouts that can change. When I was 50 years old no one had benched 550 pounds. I had a 500-pound raw bench and could lockout 600 pounds on a high pin. The shirt in about 2000 gave you about 100 pounds. The power rack made it possible to officially bench 600 pounds at 253. By doing rack lockouts in my training, I am sure rack lockouts will build your bench but wait … there’s more. Long before bench shirts, you had to be strong to be a Top 10 Bencher. Powerlifting and Bodybuilding were very close, not totally separated like today. Many Bodybuilders were great Benchers. Pat Neve and Steve Crandall were bench record holders along with Bill Seno. A massive Body Builder named Chuck Sipes was a Top IFBB Bodybuilder and a monster Bench Presser. What was his secret? You guessed it. He used a form of rack pressing with long holds—first with arms locked, and then with arms bent slightly.\nChuck would gauge his progress by holding weight for time; roughly from five seconds to 20 seconds. When he could hold a weight for 20 seconds he would add weight and start the process over. Chuck used this support workout to gain size. Normally four sets of five seconds to 20 seconds were done.\nThe rest intervals were by feel, but fast, never fully recovering to induce motor units into play. The heavy supports were done twice a week along with close-to-maximum flat benches. On other days, Chuck would do mainly regular bench and Friday lots of incline wide grips. Dumbbell inclines were done slowly with pullovers using lightweight and deep breaths along with skipping for one minute for expanding the chest. Chuck had a favorite triceps exercise for amazing strength as well as size, which was a power rack French press. First, he would set a set of pins, Then, he would start at the top of his head with a predetermined weight for five to eight reps per set up to 20 to 80 total reps. As you do this, over time, lower the pin one or two inches and work up to sets with five to eight reps and lower the pins when possible for more range of motion.\nAlways relax on the pin between reps. It’s a real power builder. Along with the bench lockouts, seated press and incline press, French presses were popular with the Culver City Westside Barbell and are still popular today with the six men at Columbus, Ohio, Westside Barbell, who hold or have held world records in the bench. Dave Hoff has the largest full meet bench press at 1,005 pounds. Isometrics are very productive for the bench. Westside uses the Hoffman method. First, set a set of pins in the power rack. Next, position a second set of pins at the angle you wish to build. Push barbell from lower pin up against the higher set of pins and hold the barbell against the pins for two to six seconds. Four or five sets work well. Three positions can be done in one workout. This will build maximum strength where you need it—at your sticking point. If you want to build explosive strength, press off a lower pin into a much higher pin as explosively as possible. Use zero stretch reflex. Let the bar rest off pins for a few seconds then blast off pins to lockout. Because the barbell weight is in the 30 to 40 percent range, six to eight reps can be done per set. Our testing at Westside has found that 48 total reps work best for explosive power. The rest interval between sets should be from two minutes to three minutes. Remember fast twitch fiber recovers slowly. I hope Westside training can make you a world record holder. Good luck,\nLouie References\nYarnell, Dave. 2011.

      "pageContent": "How to Skyrocket your Squat Louie Simmons Thu Feb 21, 2019 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.westside-barbell.com/cdn/shop/articles/skyrocketsquat_7b14feb6-9017-4dd3-bbc2-8a1a89a7faff_720x.png?v=1563691143\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" alt=\"How to Skyrocket your Squat\"> Related Topics: Conjugate Method, Exercise Programming, Louie Simmons, Strength Training Methods Sineaid Corley, a USA bobsled athlete, was training at Westside while trying to make the team again but decided she wanted to try powerlifting. She had a 325-pound squat and a 375-pound deadlift. She had been training with the athletes and she asked if I would train her. I needed a training partner for the two girls I was training at 5 am, so I said yes. (One of them holds many all-time world records, which includes the squat. We will talk about her progress at a later date.) Back to Sineaid’s story. The training was based on her 325-pound max. We worked on the three waves at 50, 55 and 60 percent with 210-pound band tension when making a 600-pound gym squat instead of 150-pound band tension (25 percent). I believe we have fully adapted to the 25 percent band tension. (This technique was used to bring Heidi Howar’s 132 world record squat from 600 to an easy 617 pounds.) We were checking her progress every seven weeks so we could adjust her training weights on squat day. With Sineaid, after starting with 50, 55 and 60 percent for her three-week wave, the weights grew fast after 15 weeks. Sineaid’s training weight increased from 165-180-195 to 300-330-360 for sets. This was fast progress for even a Westsider. In 18 weeks she competed and made a 600-pound squat at 181 body weight. Sineaid’s deadlift was another story. She had a 375 max deadlift with a tough lockout. Just like the squat, her hamstrings, glutes and hips were weak and needed lots of work. At the same time—and oh by the way—Sineaid’s second meet she pulled a 465, a 490, and an easy 500-pound deadlift. We had been pushing the Reverse Hypers for the lower back, glutes and hamstrings along with the inverse curls to isolate the hamstrings. Heavy belt squats, supports and belt squats, deadlifts and Zercher squats were done four times a week. To break up the sequence, high rep deadlifts were substituted sometimes by doing 50 reps with 135 up to 155 pounds. This builds the low back, glutes, hips and hamstrings. For GPP we went with walking in the A.T.P. Belt Squat Machine and power sled walking. Lots of abdominal work was done doing leg lifts, incline sit-ups, and high side bends. Look for Sineaid to skyrocket as we constantly work on her needs. Westside is always evolving and the added band tension is just another chapter at Westside. The regular band tension plus weight top value was 75 percent, 80 percent and 85 percent, but now it has been increased to 83 percent, 88 percent and 93 percent. The lifts are somewhat higher than A.S. Prilepin’s research data. But, remember, Prilepin’s data was from Olympic style weight lifting, which is a speed strength sport with intermediate velocity training. Powerlifting is a strength speed sport with slow velocity training. I hope this explains the tension increase reset. Let’s look at two three-week waves. First, for 550 pounds and then 600 pounds that produced a 630 gym squat.\n550 Max Squat Week Bar Weight Band Tension Sets Reps Week 1 275 210 lb 5 x 5 Week 2 300 210 lb 5 x 5 Week 3 330 210 lb 5 x 5 600 Max Squat Week Bar Weight Band Tension Sets Reps Week 1 300 210 lb 5 x 5 Week 2 330 210 lb 5 x 5 Week 3 360 210 lb 5 x 5 This produced a squat of 630 pounds making the band tension 33 percent or 210 of 630. This is how the 33 percent came into the plan. The band tension will remain 210, or 33 percent of 630. But, as the squats go up, the band tension, of course, will go down accordingly. This will remain the plan until a 700-pound squat is produced. But, regardless, stay close to the 33 percent band tension. The plan was to deadlift 500 pounds starting with a 375 deadlift with a weak lockout. A program was set that called for 5 x 5 reps with the weight going up each week; all done after speed strength squat day. The first three weeks are done from a conventional-style four-inch box. On the fourth week, switch to sumo while still standing on a four-inch box. Each week add weight to the bar. While adding weight, each week on the fourth week use a five-inch cambered bar while standing on a 10-inch box. This places the bar four inches below ground level. This is, of course, a conventional stance and is the key to teaching leg drive into back extensions. Again, use 5 x 5 reps adding weight each week. If you don’t have a five-inch cambered bar, stand on a six-inch box that puts a deadlift in front of the toes. But work with caution—do not set the bar on the top of your foot! If you get bored, pull rack pulls for one or two weeks, but keep the 5 x 5 reps. There you have it. Look for much more from Sineaid Corley in the future. Good luck, Louie",

This training activity could be jumping exercises or it could be training with weights ranging from 30 percent to 40 percent on the average. If weights are used, you produce maximal force only in the beginning—the bar is too light to produce force throughout the entire range of motion due to bar deceleration. You may use Compensatory Acceleration Training (C.A.T.), but still it is impossible to produce maximal force due to the human strength curve. Westside has solved this dilemma by using Accommodating Resistance (AR). AR is used to develop maximal tension throughout the complete range of motion. Dr. Mel Siff in his book Supertraining coined a phrase “Combinations of Resistance Methods.” For Westside, it is accomplished by using strong rubber bands attached to the bar with different band tension measured at lockout, but there must be strong tension at the bottom of the lift. Not only do rubber bands attached to the bar provide AR, but an added bonus is that they cause an over speed eccentric effect that produces greater reversal muscle action. The greater the amount of band tension, the greater the reversal muscle action. Westside chooses two special bars for explosive strength training that can substitute for front squatting: the safety squat bar and the Zercher squat harness. Westside uses a three-week wave with three amounts of band tension. The number of lifts for explosive strength is 24 minimal to 36 optimal to 48 maximal. The well trained male and female can do the maximal on week one and two, and the optimal lifts on the third week. This is due to adding greater amounts of band tension each week. The tension on week one is 210 pounds of band tension for 48 lifts. The reps and sets can be six set of eight reps or eight sets of six reps. (Note: All reps must be fast as possible on the eccentric phase and the concentric phase. All squats are box squats.) On week two the band tension is 250 pounds for 48 lifts with maximal acceleration. On week three use 320 pounds of band tension for 36 lifts. Westside suggests six sets of six reps. Rest intervals must allow for adequate rest. Bar speed must be at least 1 to 1.2 m/s for developing explosive strength.\nSpeed Strength Speed strength is trained at 75 percent to 85 percent in a repeated three-week wave. This came from the data of A. D. Ermakov and N. S. Atanasov while testing 780 highly skilled weightlifters. Refer to Managing the Training of Weight Lifters by authors N. P. Laputin and V.G. Oleshko. Olympic weightlifters must be strong in fast movements. Westside used the same percentages for years. But as of late, we have increased the percentages—not with the barbell, that remains 50 percent to 55 percent to 60 percent—but instead raised the band tension to 33 percent. This makes the top tension on week one 83 percent; week two is 88 percent, and week three is 93 percent. Why? Powerlifting is based more on strength speed or slow strength. The eight percent increase of band tension has so far produced a 606-pound and 617-pound world record squat for a 132-pound woman. Plus, a bob sledder’s squat increased from 325 pounds to 600 pounds in 15 weeks officially, and a 670-pound squat in training in 20 weeks. Westside suggests you increase your band tension to 33 percent for your speed strength workouts. Friday is speed strength squat and pull days. The added band tension decreases the bar velocity that in turn increases force development. Remember as motion velocity decreases, external resistance increases. Maximum force (Fmm) is attained when velocity is small, near zero. More can be found in Science and Practice of Strength Training by V. M. Zatsiorsky and W. J. Kraemer. This wave system is repeated throughout the year to build good form and supply high volume training with the barbell. Maximum Effort (M-E) day 72 hours later supplies low volume with the barbell to avoid accommodation to the amount of barbell training. But, remember, the small special exercises make up 80 percent of the training on both days.\nStrength Speed Strength speed is sometimes called slow strength because it is trained and developed at slow velocity. There are always problems with special training methods. If only barbell weight is used, it becomes too heavy in the bottom to overcome the load. If only band tension is used, the load will be too heavy at the top to allow the load to be started from the top of a squat. Strength speed development must incorporate the Combination of Resistance method. Westside prefers the combination of barbell weight plus band tension that exceeds the amount of bar weight. An example: 700 pounds of bands with a maximum barbell load of maybe 500 pounds. This would add up to 1,200 pounds at lockout. Here is an example of A. J. Robert’s training that consisted of two strength methods for a major meet: A total of 700 pounds of band tension at lockout plus 510 pounds of barbell weight that equals 1,210 pounds at the top for strength. The velocity was slow—about 0.4 m/s. This effort made it possible for A. J. to squat 1,205 pounds at 304 pounds body weight. (Special note: Look for more on A. J. and his circa max cycle.) I hope it is clear that you must provide greater band tension on the barbell than barbell weight. Remember A. J. and his strength speed cycle: 700 pounds of band tension and 510 pounds of barbell weight for his max. His training partner Jake Anderson with a 2,800-pound total also participated in the strength speed cycle experiment. He made a box squat with 700 pounds of band tension plus 460 pounds of barbell weight at the same meet Jake made a meet personal record with an easy 1,135. For one final stat, Sineaid Corley made a box squat with 375 pounds of band tension plus 285 pounds of barbell weight that produced 670-pound gym squat. The top valve of the bands and barbell weight equals 660 pounds. To clarify, the band tension must exceed the amount of barbell weight to cause slow velocity training that produces strength speed. The amount of lifts for strength speed is not documented, but Westside uses circa-max lifts described in Supertraining, page 394. For percents and the number of lifts, use four minimal, seven optimal, and 10 maximal. That is the data from A. S. Prilepin (1974, page 32.) For much more information, look at Supertraining, page 409 through 413. Circa-Maximal Method The Circa-Maximal method (circa-max) is for prepping for a contest. It calls for lifting a weight comprised of barbell weight only or a combination of barbell weight plus band tension. First, the circa-max phase is scheduled 28 to 14 days from the meet. Westside has normally taken the top circa-max weight 21 days from the meet, but due to raising our work capacity, Westside has shortened the phase to 14 days. At Westside the circa-max top weight is now 14 days out from meet time with 21 days out being a deload to 50 percent. That is done to prepare the lifter to lift a new max box squat, but not a top-limit squat. Remember, whether near-max or circa-max, always leave something. Seven days out take 75 percent of the top squat on 14 days out. Both squats should be made on the seven lifts. It is best while working up to do two sets of two reps then three singles to make the planned weight, just like a meet. Supertraining states that circa-max percentages range from 90 percent to 97 percent. For more, go to page 394 in Supertraining. The number of lifts is detailed in Managing the Training of Weight Lifters, page 32. As you have read in the article, there have been changes in the Westside system, which involves adding a small increase in band tension. Also, the speed strength pulls have been raised from eight to 10 lifts to 20 speed pulls. This was on the recommendation of Boris Sheiko as his squat and deadlift volume are equal. Without change your training becomes stagnant and this can never happen!\nLouie",

Here are some pointers of why and how we do things:\n-We use the Bully Cambered Bar as our main bar. This is due to the placing on the weight in relation to the lifter's center of mass as well as it's ease on the shoulders.\n-When doing them concentrically, 90% of the time we'll do it out of chain (pictured above), as it allows for a more manipulative ROM.\n-The Safety Bar is our #2 choice followed by the Bow Bar, again for the ease of the shoulders.\n-Front bands whether out the Monolift or power rack (pictured above) is very common as it teaches the lifter to 'pull back' rather than 'pull up'.",

People came from all over the world to attend the Arnold Classic and hundreds of them came here to see the facility. We believe in what we do, and it was very exciting to host so many followers of the conjugate system. We are so very grateful to all the people who came to visit and pay their respects. Even more, we stand in awe of the company of people who showed up this weekend to move something and hit a PR. The true value of a pilgrimage is measured by the effort and sacrifice required. Westside isn't some stale Hall of Fame or dusty museum. We would like to commend all those who showed up to help demonstrate that to the world.It started Friday morning with this big guy who couldn't fit a wristband. Right after him was this high school kid; it didn't stop there, we had 21 PR's Friday. It was incredible, every hour's group had at least one person trying for a lifetime best lift. Saturday was even better, we ended up with 27 PR's. There were even four more on Sunday from some people who just couldn't leave without getting one. People of every size and shape came here to make their best effort. We are thankful to have been here to see it. But it wasn't just the effort in the gym we appreciate and value. So many people came from so far away. It is humbling to be the focus of so many positive thoughts and good feelings. Many of our visitors this weekend were just glad to be here. It is a privilege to host someone at a place which is so special to them. We would like to thank all of you for coming.Stay Strong,Louie Simmons & Westside Barbell HQ Staff",
